## Duke Trial Innovation Center Mockup

### Overview

The intention of the main page is to provide a palatable landing page to accommodate any sort of visitor to the site. This page consists of a few focused CTA links to simply route users to the appropriate places.

The sections are very minimal and very general at this point. They are also quite typical until further details are learned.

The _about_ page will detail the Trial Innovation Center and/or Network, providing a general overview of the work that is done and the process through which proposals are processed.

A _Start a Proposal_ page would give guidance to researchers on how to begin their proposals or to elevate their existing poropsals to the next level.

A _Reports_ page gives an overview of general counts and results, perhaps the number of proposals that have been approved since the inception of the TIC, the universities where proposals originate, or the popular areas of research.

The _Dashboard_ is a more focused reporting platform requiring authentication. This will provide a more robust means for customizing database queries and analyses.
