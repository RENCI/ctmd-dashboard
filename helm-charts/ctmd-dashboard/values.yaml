# Default values for ctmd-dashboard. This is the parent chart to launch
# the full service. 
# Helm treats empty string as valid so to use defaults, leave completely blank.
# Areas where defaults can be used will be explicitly commented.

# TODO (Phase 2): 
#  - postgres.persistence should support mounting existing pvc when deploying (currently does not).
#  - Add further security considerations - runAsRoot: false type stuff
#  - Develop mode should make use of syntheticDataset.json mount in /files dir
#       while prod deployment should not. Have an opinionated dev env
#  - Still trying to understand pipeline envs AUXILLARY_PATH, FILTER_PATH, BLOCK_PATH
