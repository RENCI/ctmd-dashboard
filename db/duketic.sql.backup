426	~$4 million over 5 years	\N	\N	Detailed budget has not been developed by the study team. Only high level estimates based upon the study team's proposed design were available. Upon initial review, a budget of <$500K per year seems achievable, but the budget will fluctuate until concrete design decisions are made.  We plan to assist in the development of the budget as part of a Comprehensive Consultation.

207	5M (if allowed to go over cap)	45,000 (for possible EFIC activities at 6 sites in Y1 - this may not be needed)	5M	The following consideration were discussed/recommended as follows: \n\n-Power study for 90%: The PIs should consider powering the study at 90% vs 80% (especially as it relates to the subgroup of 0-3 years olds that they are also interested in assessing). To do this, 2-3 additional sites would likely need to be added in order to complete recruitment within the planned recruitment timeline. The Investigators estimated that powering the study at 90% power (and increasing the sample size to approximately 4,346 from 3,268) would require 2 additional sites and an additional $180,000/year which may not be financially feasible.\n-EFIC Activities: During the initial consultation, it was noted that EFIC activities would not be likely, although possible. The UC-Davis IRB required a somewhat atypical, hybrid EFIC model for the pilot study. The budget includes Y1 support for each site in the event EFIC is required, but these funds could be re-allocated if it is not required. \n-Current budget assumes imaging data management is being handled by UC-Davis. If this were to be managed by Utah TIC and data coordinating center personnel, this would be an additional cost above current budget. \n-Current budget (of 5M) assumes Investigators will be allowed to go above the cap, but it seems more likely that this budget will go in under cap at <500K/year (2.5M total over 5 years) restricting funds to half.

198	\N	\N	\N	The Utah TIC advised Dr. Simpson and his study team that they should re-organize their budget so they are not paying the participating centers a per-patient enrolled reimbursement, but are reimbursing for general milestones met (e.g. participated in training; 25 subjects enrolled; cost of hosting the research coodinator).

The Utah TIC recommends creating a CMS coverage analysis to verify coverage. The coverage analysis can be provided to sites if necessary. \n\nThe Utah TIC also provided a budget for DCC services. If the budget does not fit within the allowed budget cap, site monitoring costs can be adjusted.

Some key concerns were addressed, such as, the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in people with Cerebral Palsy and Spina Bifida. This will rise ethical issues when attempting to consent via self-registry. Consider a "teach back" method element in the online consent process. Potential subjects will need to correctly answer a few questions about the consent information before they will be approved for inclusion. Self-enrollment may complicate this issue, if the participant does not have the capacity to provide the consent that is being requested. Self-registering may also be a filter for someone who does not have the cognitive abilities and leave an important part of the population out of the registry. It was recommended to consider verifying identity with 2 factor verification when recruiting online. \n\nIt may be possible to get a legal representative to enroll the subject, but family members of those patients with disabilities may really discourage pregnancy. Concern that you may not get an honest answer about reproductive intent if legal representative learns disabled person is interested in reproduction.\n\nDiscussion that whole genome-sequencing is a complicated domain and advised that the study PI remove this from the initial grant (Spec Aim 5). Utah Ethicists brought up concerns around specific aim 2 and 5 at the initial consult meeting (on April 11th), which the study PI removed by the next meeting (on April 16th).

The surgeons should be trained in the UK surgical procedures, be like-minded and agree with the systematic approach for reproducibility.

But NIA considers a UCLA DSMB a Conflict of Interest. \n•\tPI seeking DSMB members who understand pragmatic trials; one pharmacist already identified to serve.\n•\tPI has pursued a couple other options.\no\tDCRI quote for about ~60K/year to set up DSMB. \n\tPI interested in allocating funds for DSMB but DCRI price exceeded expectations. \no\tOther two site PIs have experience assembling DSMBs and could help set up one\n\nJHU/Tufts TIC Assessment\nJHU-Tufts Trial Innovation Center (TIC) spent some time discussing this proposal internally and with Dr. Pevnick. The JHU/Tufts TIC leadership team had concerns regarding the efficacy and safety of the study. The JHU/Tufts TIC was interested in hosting the DMSB. But if we were to host it, then we would want the ability to put the study on hold from either a futility or safety patient perspective. Our feedback was the following:\n•\tEfficacy Concerns: Recognize the risk to the hypothesis. Other similar programs may exists in the hospitals or within an insurance company. Confirm whether or not similar programs exist at other sites. \n•\tSafety Concerns: There is the potential that a pharmacist may discontinue an essential medication that was prescribed by another healthcare team member. Are there safety mechanisms in place to deter this from occurring?\n•\tIntermediate review: Suggest intermediate look for harm. \n•\tReadmission endpoint: Readmission is a complicated endpoint. Consider a secondary endpoint or sensitivity analysis that focuses on multiple medication-related problems that caused the readmission. \n\nFollow-Up\nAfter the JHU/Tufts TIC presented its concerns to the PI, the PI took some time to discuss the feedback with his collaborators. After further reflection, the PI declined the DSMB resource offer and decided to pursue another route.\nThe JHU/Tufts TIC welcomes discussing future opportunities on other potential projects and hope to collaborate with the study team in the near future.

The Network focuses on prospective multi-center randomized clinical trials that have an opportunity to study an innovative operational approach to improve quality, efficiency or cost of clinical research. \n\nShould you engage industry or NIH Institutes & Centers for future funding, we would be pleased to assist you in developing the prospective study proposal and assessing areas such as study design, outcomes, budget and recruitment. After working with the Penn State Clinical and Science Translational Institute on developing the proposal, we encourage you to resubmit to the Trial Innovation Network for an initial consultation.

Because UC-Davis already has data on the population enrolled from the previous pilot trial, it may be better not to include them as a site in this trial. On the other hand, from the PI perspective, it is difficult to stay in tune with the day-to-day management and detail of a study when not involved as a participating site. It was recommended that this potential question be addressed in the grant application.\n-Consider including only one primary outcome (the first outcome listed) and moving the second primary outcome to the list of secondary outcomes. This may be a better strategy moving forward and  may be better received at study section.

Given that regulatory approval is not sought in this project, this is a "Clinical Effectiveness Trial," and not necessarily E2E or EE2.  The main objective appears to be clinical effectiveness in the real world; the principles of testing in real-world settings in usual care. That said, for scientific purposes, this could be done with an EE2 focus, depending on the specific objectives of the PI.  \n\nIn terms of assessment of effectiveness, a "pragmatic trial" approach that does not allow for a fully RCT design may not provide a useful answer for practice (and payers).  While an effectiveness trial approach is encouraged, many of the shortcuts of fully RCT design done under the banner of "pragmatic trial" will not support these objectives.\n\nThat said, what qualifies as care that should be acceptable in usual care should be defined.  From Fields' work in carotid endarterectomy based on echo-detected carotid bruits, we know that when comparing care by the originator/expert clinician to usual care, the risk-benefit balance can reverse in terms of justification for patient care.  The PI will need to address this for this trial. \n\nAlthough this will no doubt be addressed by the statisticians, there seems no need for the two-to-one matching, and one-to-one seems more advisable.\n\nThe trial endpoints are reasonable, and it was good to hear that patients and clinician stakeholders have been involved in devising and using (in the registry) the patient functional scales.  The PI will need to specify what will be considered a clinical meaningful difference on the scales, and these specifications should be used for power analyses.\n\nFormal cost-effectiveness outcomes should be planned carefully with support from those with substantial experience in this kind of data, including those with connections to payers, so that the results will have utility as intended for the marketplace.

This would involve additional funding from Dr. Khosla, and also involve the idea of incorporating an operational hypothesis and innovations into the execution of the multi-center trial. \nUltimately, however, Dr. Khosla decided that Mayo and UCSF were better suited to be the DCC/CCC as they have collaborated previously and have expertise in the area of osteoporosis trials. The UCSF Co-PI oversees a fairly large clinical coordinating effort specifically related to NIH and industry studies related to osteoporosis.

There will be a need to pre-define the variables that will be used to move a patient from one therapy to another or a combined therapy to another (Need to know when one pathway will be rejected and a new one will be initiated). Adapt the trials around the biomarkers that are mostly kinematic measures but eventually come to image-based measures or biochemical measures. Develop a platform where data can be clustered across multiple interventions which would be the first platform of its kind in neurological disease space. Discussion around the need to include not only impairment outcome biomarkers but also include quality of life outcomes as they can be practical, personal and financial measures of therapy success.  Although secondary endpoints, quality of life outcomes are important for scalability and applicability, and will be an expectation during peer review for funding and editorial review prior to publication.  Suggestion to conduct focus groups to determine the important outcomes for the patients. There was also a discussion around the fact the Hopkins TIC has experience in building mathematical models to adaptive design that improve effect size and reduce sample numbers. \nCONSORTIUM: The discussion centered around the idea of task allocation as this network develops between a Core Lab, a Data Coordinating Center and a Clinical Coordinating Center. Other topics discussed were: the PI should always have the ability to have access to the study data, and  meta data around trial execution and  the addition of operational hypothesis and innovation will be requirements if this study moves forward with the Trial Innovation Network.

The study team is looking at traditional fidelity measures such as intervention reach and adoption; what else should they consider if they establish efficacy to show they aren't too far from effectiveness given this is a real world intervention?\nDr. Harry Selker, Principal Investigator of the Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA), provided some context and advice to Dr. Wieland. After reviewing the proposal, Dr. Selker concluded this study is more of an EE2 trial, since it includes participants based on effectiveness criteria and looks at an efficacy outcome. This is rare and superior to an E2E trial.  Additionally, the Dr. Wieland's question "are there implementation measures that would shrink the efficacy to effectiveness gap?" is now moot after this analysis. Suggestions for next steps would be for Dr. Wieland to disseminate this study more broadly across the country and go through PCORI for a dissemination project. \n \nAnother suggestion was to find a parallel population to obtain baseline event rates and baseline effectiveness on standard of care compared to the intervention group.  Suggestion to obtain info from public data sources or public health assessments. \n\nBest Practices for Multi-site Clinical Trial-\nThis is the PI's first multi-center trial and he was interested in some advice on best practices for running a multi-center trial. Specifically he had questions regarding best practices for communication, data handling, regulatory environment, etc.\nCommunication-\n•\tCreate a managerial structure that allows the PI to know what is happening at the other sites; This person should not be the study PI but report directly to the PI (i.e. a Project Manager).\no\tEnsure that a Mayo Project Manager provides oversight to the other two enrolling sites.\no\tThe Mayo PM can help problem solve and mitigate issues and help to ensure high quality data from the other sites. \n•\tFrequent assessment of the intervention fidelity is important. If the intervention is not being rendered appropriately, there needs to be an improvement process in place.\no\tThe two most common reasons for an effect size not being reproduced is the population is different than the pilot or the intervention isn't being rendered as closely as it was done in the test population.\n\nData Handling-\nRegularly review the data collected and ensure it is being collected properly; prioritize the key pieces of data and ensure important data is not missing.\n•\tMonitor screening and enrollment on a weekly basis \nRisk Assessment\n•\tConsider an outside third party assessment of the study risks to identify places where the study could go wrong. \n•\tConsider reaching out locally at Mayo Clinic for assistance with this. Find a set of colleagues who have already completed this type of study and could assess global risk to your trial (i.e. technology risks - not everyone who has a cell phone and can't receive texts.)\n\nSite Monitoring-\n•\tSmall portion of budget already allotted to ensuring the intervention fidelity (sit-ins at the clinics)\no\tDetermine who will be doing this assessment and who will be assessed (RCs, PI). \no\tConsider an independent monitor. \n•\tDetermine key performance indicators that you could monitor during the study

Create a log for types of fluid given; include volumes, dates & times of administration\n2. Record name, date, and time of first dose of antibiotics administered\n3. Define comorbidities and decide if pre-admission drugs need to be captured\n4. Refine the types of fluids collected\n5. Use a drop-down menu for the Site of infection data element, instead of a free-text field.  Rename this field Primary site of infection\n6. Remove the Length of stay data element for each hospital unit.  Add dates and times of discharge.\n7. Have the research coordinator upload any culture results for review that are not negative; Add: gender, randomization number based on envelopes, change age to DOB\nChallenge: Which organization(s) will be responsible for the following tasks:  Developing the CRF, querying the data, performing site monitoring, and establishment of a DSMB?\n\nDiscussion Summary: The PIs were discouraged from further developing the CRF, since this is automated in current web-based electronic data capture (EDC) systems. In a multicenter trial such as this proposal, the data coordinating center would take care of managing the EDC.  This facilitates data quality monitoring and risk based site monitoring.\nRecommendations: \n1. The Utah TIC would function as the DCC to perform all data and study management.  \n2. The TIC would provide:\n    a. Data necessary to determine the amount of cross-overs\n    b. Remote site monitoring on an established basis\n    c. Write the charter and coordinate the DSMB meetings\n3.\tInvestigate if the sites' CTSAs can perform local monitoring, leveraging their Hub architecture.\n___________________________________________________________\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nChallenge: Is the current statistical approach best for this study?\n\nDiscussion Summary: A discussion on the potential for blinding occurred; however, this would take away from the concept of "pragmatic" and could make the project infeasible.  In addition, the majority of clinicians are aware of differences between the two liquids considered.  Adaptive enrichment of the study population was discussed.  However, such a feature would detract from the "pragmatic" nature of the trial.  Three types of allocation were discussed: patient-level randomization, site-level (cluster) randomization, and systematic allocation.  Patient-level randomization is clearly the best in this study.  Participant will be randomized using an envelope system as it is simple and allows quick randomization.  \n\nOne of the main goals of the pilot study is to assess the level of adherence in each group, particularly in the LR group.  The original proposal was to look at comparing actual fluid proportions between arms, but it was decided that a better measure would be the proportion of patients for which a certain threshold proportion of fluid was reached.  In the larger study, the proposed sample size would provide enough power to detect varying potential differences (e.g., 4% mortality in NS group vs 2.5% mortality in LR group).  Subgroup analyses were redefined to ensure all subgroups could be classified pre-hospital admission.  The subgroups factors that will be considered for formal analysis are age, gender, cancer, and AKI/CKD at presentation.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Do not attempt to blind physicians\n2. Adaptive enrichment of the study population should not be done\n3. Utilize patient-level randomization with an envelope system\n4. Redefine subgroups for analysis to age, gender, and AKI/CKD at presentation\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nIND APPLICATION\nChallenge: Does the TIC have IND application resources or should the IND application process remain at CHOP?\n\nDiscussion Summary: While the Utah TIC has resources to assist with the IND, CHOP currently has a group dedicated to helping investigators with the IND application.  The group will provide consultations and recommendations, as well as a liaison to the FDA contact.  Dr. Weiss has worked with this group and is preparing to submit the IND application the week of 03/06/17.  \nRecommendations: \n1. Formally request a pre-IND review\n2. Continue to work with IND group at CHOP

Overall, he thinks it is a good study\n• Dan Hanley and Mike Dean do not consider this study coming out of Duke as potential conflict for Duke.\n• Dan Hanley asked for clarification on the power of the study, and considers the patient size to be high. He noted this study has been reviewed enthusiastically by NHLBI, and the only major negative is the absence of US sites; He noted the study will need site development work in the initial consultation\n• Gordon Bernard noted this study could have a huge impact and is a practical intervention\n• Paul Harris noted that while it would be interesting to partner with PCORNet, the Network might not get a big bang for your buck; He noted the turnaround for proposal itself is short, because they want to submit letter to NHBLI in October because they have a higher than 500k budget\n• This study is over the PPG limit\n• Steve Mayo noted it will be useful to gather protocol information not provided in original submission during the initial consultation\n• Tiina Urv noted it is important to see the summary statements that were in the grant. In NIH, when you have internal grant, you have to make a case for why the sites cannot be in the US. It needs to look like a partnership, because NIH does not want the majority of the money going to Sweden. Currently, of the $7 million budget, $5 million will go to Sweden. She noted it will be important for the study to include a population group that is relevant to US patients\n• Gordon Bernard noted that the scientific credibility of the study findings may be thrown into question because of the homogeneity in Sweden.\n• Michelle Culp is concerned about the number of sites participating and the feasibility of recruiting from 40+ sites. She noted recruitment will be a huge effort and has concerns over the feasibility. She requested clarification on how PCORNet will be involved. \n• Michelle Culp noted NHLBI is enthusiastic about the study, and considers it an opportunity to test the process of NHBLI working with Network and Study Investigator to develop an application\n• Next Steps: Come up with a tight timeline on getting back to the investigator because of their upcoming deadline

He noted that it would not be possible to completely separate ourselves from the international sites. He does not think standard agreements could handle this study, nor does he think the group should make decisions based on NHLBI enthusiasm.\n•\tMarianne Gildea voted against the proposal.\n•\tLupe Aquino voted against the proposal, and is in agreement with everyone else's comments.\n•\tTiina Urv countered everyone's comments on NHLBI's enthusiasm by stating that because it is a large grant, the institute does need to show a lot of interest or they will likely not push it forward.\n•\tMonica Shah agreed with Steve Mayo on avoiding voting on NIH enthusiasm. However, she also said that providing this service for 100 domestic sites seems feasible, but NYU has already received a service from the network. Therefore, if we did want to approve this, we would ask them to include a line item for CIRB in their grant application.

300	2018-03-12	55	\N	\N	A cluster-randomized trial comparing team-based versus primary care clinician-led advance care planning in practice-based research networks	Meta-LARC ACP	6	The study is designed to promote serious illness care planning so that patients with advanced illnesses and limited life expectancies can spend more time at home and receive care concordant with their goals. We plan to compare two models for implementing an evidence-based, widely used, and freely available advance care planning program called the Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) in primary care practices. Our study will determine which model produces better patient outcomes at 6 months and 1 year after enrollment.	We will conduct a multicenter cluster randomized trial comparing two models for implementing SICP. The two models are 1) primary care clinician-focused SICP and 2) team-based SICP. Units of randomization will be enrolled primary care practices from across seven geographically diverse practice-based research networks (PBRNs) that are part of the Meta-network Learning And Research Center (Meta-LARC). Each participating PBRN will recruit practices to reach the goal of 160 eligible and enrolled patients who complete followup across all the participating practices for each PBRN. Practices will be randomized to SICP arm. Multilevel modeling will be used to account for the hierarchical structure of the data. The trial will comply with CONSORT guidelines adapted for reporting cluster randomized trials.	Our objective is to determine if it is more effective to focus SICP implementation on a model where a single primary care clinician is responsible for the conversation and planning, given the nature of the patient-clinician relationship, or use a team-based model, given the time and resource constraint on clinicians. Our aims are to:\n1.\tAssess the comparative effectiveness in primary care of team-based SICP vs. primary care clinician-focused SICP on concordance of care with patient goals and time spent at home (primary outcomes) and secondary outcomes (e.g., anxiety, depression, quality of life).\n2.\tExplore contextual factors influencing the implementation of the two different models of SICP and how these vary across the primary care practices, with a focus on the comparison of practices in the U.S. and Canada and on practice-level characteristics (e.g., size, rural/urban, affiliation with an integrated health system, prior advance care planning activities, PCP staff disciplines and training)	The primary outcomes are a) goal concordant care, that is whether care received corresponds to patient goals, a patient reported outcomes measure and (b) time spent at home Both will be measured at six-months as well 1-year after enrollment. These will be measured at the patient level and compared across the two models, but can also be compared at the cluster level. Several secondary outcomes will be included as well. Common measures are being coordinated across the advance care planning and community palliative care projects funded by PCORI in order to allow comparisons across projects as appropriate.	1	Patients must be adults (over 18 years of age), community dwelling (i.e., not residents of nursing homes), and have a serious illness or condition that is likely to limit their life expectancy to less than 2 years as defined by using either an algorithm or clinical intuition or both. Inclusion is not limited to patients with any specific condition. Patients could have diagnoses of heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, debilitating stroke, multiple diagnoses, or any other life-limiting condition such as frailty. \n\nPatients may not already be enrolled in hospice or currently in an ICU or hospital with no expectation of discharge. Patients who have advance directive documents (e.g., a do not resuscitate order [DNR] or Physicians orders for life sustaining care [POLST]) will not be excluded as these documents do not mean that discussions and planning are finished or static given that options and values may change over time. Family members and care partners will be recruited from those named by patients when the patients are asked if there is a person who is most involved in their health care.	Primary care practices will be recruited by seven primary care PBRNs that provide care to approximately three million patients in five U.S. states (OR, WI, CO, IA, NC) and two Canadian provinces (QB, ON) from practices that are members of these networks. The PBRNs all have experience in recruiting practices for participation in research and supporting patient identification and enrollment. Each of the seven PBRNs will recruit 6-8 practices (42-56 practices) and 170 participants (1,190 participants) will be recruited from each PBRN.	Arm 1: Clinician-focused ACP model\nThe clinician-focused model will center serious illness care planning on the conversations between a single primary care clinician (physicians, NPs, PAs) and the patient and family. In this model, the primary care clinician who is knowledgeable about the patient provides individualized assessment and care. The clinician will receive SICP training and utilize SICP tools to have serious illness care conversations and help them plan. Training will include how to identify appropriate patients, skills for initial and follow-up serious illness conversations, and how to document the conversation and planning in the medical record. Serious illness care planning benefits from individualized assessment and care from a clinician who knows the patient and has medical expertise; this is emphasized in the clinician-focused model. \n\nArm 2: Team-based ACP model\nThe team-based model will also draw on the medical expertise of the clinician; however, the team identified by the practice will receive training and use SICP tools. Team members will share care planning tasks appropriate to their scope of practice and coordinate communication and follow-up across the team consisting of the primary care clinician and at least one other person from a different profession or practice role (e.g., nurses, care managers, social workers, medical assistants, chaplains, peer counselors, community health workers etc.). Training will include how to divide the tasks and work together as a team in addition to the SICP-specific training provided in the clinician-focused arm. In this model, non-primary care clinician team members become involved in conversations with the patient, family, and care partners. The team-based approach focuses on the importance of having time and ability to address the holistic range of patient and family concerns in serious illness care planning.	18 months to complete enrollment and 24 months of follow-up, for a total of 42 months	12 months	\N	We will perform a descriptive analysis of practice, clinician, and patient characteristics to assure comparability of the two study arms and we will include potentially confounding variables as covariates in analyses. Multilevel modeling will be used to account for the hierarchical structure of the data. We will specify random effects at the practice (cluster) level and, when comparing baseline to follow-up, at the respondent level. For each outcome, we will assess goodness of fit and model assumptions. For binary outcomes, we will use either the mean proportions from logistic regression or risk-difference regression to estimate the difference between arms. For days at home, we will evaluate Poisson or negative binomial models for fit and include days observed as an offset, or rate denominator.\n\nPrimary analyses will be conducted under an intention to treat assumption, and thus missing data will be multiple imputed using baseline measurements and standard tools. Because missingness may be informative in this study, we also plan to evaluate potential bias with (1) a worst-case sensitivity analysis, in which the 'worst' outcome is substituted for missing outcomes, and (2) a Heckman selection model,31 in which we will model the probability of having non-missing outcome data using available information, then test the correlation between the residuals of that model and the residuals in our main outcome model. A non-zero correlation indicates the presence of bias. This approach will also allow us to compare bias-corrected with uncorrected estimates of treatment effects.\n\nWe will test for significant heterogeneity of effects in subgroups defined by practice and patient characteristics, including location in the U.S. vs. Canada or in urban vs. rural environments, number of clinic providers/FTE, and clinical or diagnostic subgroups (e.g., cancer, advanced chronic conditions, frailty/advanced age, and dementia). We will include interaction terms for these groups (model * characteristic) in our models; rejection of the null hypothesis that the interaction is equal to zero or a large estimated effect will be considered evidence of subgroup difference. \n\nAfter we have collected six-month outcomes on 408 participants (12 per cluster), we will conduct an interim analysis to determine whether to stop. Specifically, we will perform a one-sided test at α=0.05 against a null hypothesis that the proportion of patients in both arms combined reporting goal-concordant care is 0.15. Because we will not be comparing the two approaches, we not need to un-blind the statisticians or adjust significance levels of primary analyses for multiple comparisons. Our effective sample size at this point will be 408/DE = 263, where DE = 1 + (m-1)ρ = 1 + (12-1)(0.05), and to reject the null with 90% power, our observed proportion will need to be 0.22 or higher. We choose these cutoff proportions because failure to reject the null would mean that (a) neither arm is performing meaningful ACP, or (b) one arm is outperforming the other dramatically, e.g. 0.10 in one arm and 0.34 in the other, which average to 0.22. While not expected, either of these cases provides justification for stopping.	\N

In more than 85% of individuals, the disease onset is during the first 5 years of life and is present in 65% by 2 years of age.  When encountered in adults, the disease has generally been present for decades. The course of AD beginning in infancy has largely been unpredictable, beyond that more severe disease tends to be more persistent. Nevertheless, the reason for persistence in some pediatric patients, but clearance in others during childhood, is unknown. We hypothesize that we will be able to predict clearance vs persistence and the risk of developing other atopic disorders based on biomarker discovery. In preliminary studies, we have found several immune and barrier biomarkers that predict AD severity in full-thickness lesional biopsy samples of 0-2 year olds with onset during the previous 6 months; more recently, we were able to use relatively noninvasive techniques (blood draw and painless tape stripping) to generate large gene and protein databases (using gene  arrays and OLINK proteomics). \nWe hypothesize that spontaneous, age-related disease resolution in children will be accompanied by: i) increased differentiation of Th1 T-cells as counter-regulatory to the increased Th2; ii) Induction of T-regs that suppress all subsets; and/or iii) reciprocal up-regulation of Th1/Th17 cells, which synergistically suppress Th2 cell production. Furthermore, we hypothesize that continuing AD activity reflects the persistence of epidermal barrier abnormalities and immature or imbalanced skin-homing CLA+ T cell differentiation in children affected by AD. In contrast, normalization of the barrier and skin immunity occurs concordant with clearance of AD during childhood. Finally, we expect that circulating biomarkers will be useful in predicting both disease course and the future development of co-morbidities.\nUsing non-invasive technology, we will serially collect tape strips (6 month intervals) and blood samples (1 year intervals) from 500 children, all enrolled during the first two years of the study; for comparison, control tape strips and blood will be collected from 140 healthy children (~20 samples at each age from 1-7 years of age).	In this longitudinal multi-center non-interventional study, children under 2 years of age with the onset of AD during the previous 6 months will be enrolled at 4 major pediatric AD centers (Lurie Children's of Chicago; Boston Children's; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; and Rady Children's Hospital of San Diego, each site engaging pediatric dermatology and pediatric allergy). Demographic, personal and family history, allergic and neuropsychiatric comorbidity development, and AD severity information will be collected at each visit, with the expectation that approximately half of the children will have mild disease and the other half moderate-to-severe disease at enrollment. Tape strips will be a source of mRNA (epidermal gene expression by RNASeq), as well as stratum corneum lipids (for later lipidomic analysis). Blood samples will be used for RNASeq (blood cells), OLINK Proteomics, and specific IgE assessments (selected allergens and S. aureus). To maximize longitudinal assessments, we will cap enrollment by two years of study initiation, and run the first batch of laboratory assessments 4 years after initiation, to ensure at least two years in the study; skin and blood will continue to be collected to study end with the hope that we will be able to continue observation and serial collection for at least two grant cycles. Biomarker data will be compared with disease course (persistence, comorbidity development) to develop predictive panels.

54	2016-12-06	7	\N	\N	Metformin in Alzheimer's Dementia Prevention (MAP)	MAP Study	3	The goal of this 5-year project entitled 'Metformin in Alzheimer's dementia Prevention (MAP)', is to conduct a phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multisite clinical trial of the medication metformin for the prevention of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) in persons with prodromal Alzheimer's disease, including amnestic mild-cognitive impairment (AMCI), and pre-AMCI.   This proposal builds on the findings of a phase II study of metformin in AMCI (acronym: Met-MCI; clinical trials.gov ID NCT00620191) funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Pilot Clinical Trials program of the National Institute on Aging (R01 AG026413) and the Alzheimer's Disease Drug Discovery Foundation (Grant 270901). Met-MCI was a single-site, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin, a safe and inexpensive medication used in diabetes prevention and treatment, at 1000 mg twice a day for 12 months, in 80 subjects aged 55 to 90 years with AMCI without treated diabetes and a Body Mass Index (BMI) ? 25 m/k2. Compared to placebo, the metformin arm in Met-MCI showed a significant benefit in total recall of the Selective Reminding Test (SRT), 4 a primary clinical outcome. Findings for the secondary outcome, relative glucose uptake (rCMRgl) in the posterior cingulate-precuneus measured with brain [18]F-labeled 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), were not significant but favored metformin. The goal of Met-MCI was to collect preliminary data on efficacy, safety, and feasibility to inform a Phase III trial of metformin in the prevention of AD.The primary mechanism hypothesized to mediate the benefit of metformin in AD prevention is decreases in peripheral insulin. Elevated peripheral insulin is an AD risk factor possibly because it causes reductions in brain insulin, a feature of AD brains, that may lead to down-regulation of Insulin Degrading Enzyme and decreased clearance of brain amyloid ? (A?), a key process in AD expression. These observations have supported testing strategies that reduce peripheral insulin and increase brain insulin for AD prevention or treatment. Metformin decreases peripheral insulin and also favorably affects Advanced Glycation End-products (AGE), inflammation, coagulation, and the metabolic syndrome (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia), factors that may increase AD risk. Metformin is safer than the thiazolidenidiones, and may be more effective than diet and exercise in the long term in reducing peripheral insulin. These benefits of metformin and our preliminary data strongly support MAP, a multisite Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial lasting 24 months in 600 subjects with AMCI and pre-AMCI to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin, 1000 mg twice a day, to prevent memory decline in persons with AMCI without diabetes and a BMI ? 25 m/k2. We also propose to conduct brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to ascertain changes in brain structure and cerebrovascular disease. Our overall hypothesis is that Metformin will cause less decline in memory and less brain atrophy at 24 months, compared with placebo.	This study will be a 24-month double-blind placebo-controlled, 1:1 randomized trial of metformin 1000 mg twice a day vs. matching placebo in 600 subjects with pre AMCI and AMCI. There will be 2 primary outcomes: (1) changes in Total Recall Score of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and (2) changes in with the pre-clinical Alzheimer cognitive composite from the Alzheimer's disease cooperative study (ADCS-PACC). The secondary outcomes will be changes in total brain volume ascertained on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and changes in white matter hyperintensity volume ascertained on brain MRI. Cognitive assessments will occur every six months (baseline, six months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months). Brain MRI will be conducted at baseline and 24 months.	Primary aim: To compare changes from baseline to 24 months in verbal memory performance, measured with Total Recall Score of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and overall cognitive performance measured with the pre-clinical Alzheimer cognitive composite from the Alzheimer's disease cooperative study (ADCS-PACC), between the metformin and placebo arms.    Hypothesis 1: The metformin arm will show better verbal memory performance and better overall cognitive performance compared with placebo.      Secondary aim 1: To compare changes in total brain volumes ascertained on brain MRI from baseline to 24 months between metformin and placebo.    Hypothesis 2: The metformin arm will show less brain atrophy compared with placebo.     Secondary aim 2: To compare changes in cerebrovascular disease, ascertained as white matter hyperintensity volume on brain MRI, from baseline to 24 months between metformin and placebo.    Hypothesis 3: The metformin arm will show less increase in white matter hyperintensity volume compared with placebo    Secondary aim 3: To examine whether the effect of metformin on the primary and secondary outcomes is modified by age, APOE-e4 genotype, pre-AMCI vs. AMCI status, and degree of insulin resistance ascertained with the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA).    Hypothesis 4: The benefit of metformin on the primary and secondary outcomes will be strongest among younger subjects, those without APOE-e4, those with pre-AMCI, and those with the highest insulin resistance.	We will have 2 primary endpoints: (1) changes in  Total Recall Score of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test; (2) changes in the pre-clinical Alzheimer cognitive composite (PACC) from the Alzheimer's disease cooperative study (ADCS). The ADCS-PACC combines tests that assess episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition	1	o   Inclusion Criteria    �  Diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (AMCI) by Petersen Criteria.

Metformin will be titrated from 500 mg once a day to 1000 mg twice a day over one month. Participants will remain on the highest dose of metformin that is tolerated.	We are planning a project of 5 years duration (standard NIH R01 grant).	Recruitment will take 2 years at a rate of 25 subjects per month for all sites (between 2 and 3 subjects per site for 10 sites). The trial duration is 24 months per subject. We plan to have 6 months at the end for the grant for data closeout, final data review, data lock, and analyses.	\N	Analytic Plan for the Primary Aim. The primary aim for this study is to compare changes from baseline to 24 months in verbal memory performance, measured with Total Recall Score of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and overall cognitive performance, measured with the Alzheimer cognitive composite from the Alzheimer's disease cooperative study (ADCS-PACC), between the metformin and placebo arms. The primary null hypothesis H0 states that there is no difference between metformin and placebo arms on change in total recall in the SRT from baseline to 24 months of follow-up. We will follow the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle in which participants are analyzed based on the group to which they are randomized regardless of early termination, missing data or errors in randomization detected post hoc.  To test H0, we will use linear regression to compare metformin and placebo controlling for site, because randomization will be conducted within each of the  study sites.  The primary analysis model is of the form EY =?+?T+??iXi for i=1,..., 12, where EY is the expected change in total recall in the SRT from baseline to 24 months, Xi denotes an indicator for study site i , and T is the treatment indicator for metformin (vs. placebo). The regression coefficient ? estimates the expected mean difference in the changes the primary outcomes between the 2 arms, and thus represents the effect of metformin treatment on the primary outcomse.  Assuming no significant group differences in participant characteristics at p < 0.05 two-tailed, the primary analyses will be those described above. If there are any significant group differences in baseline participant characteristics, we will adjust for such variables in the regression models and report the adjusted treatment coefficient, and its significance level, in the primary results. In secondary analyses, we will check for a treatment by site interaction. If this is significant at the .05 level, we will attempt to determine potential effect modifiers, i.e., measured variables that (i) relate to outcome, (ii) have different mean level across sites, and (iii) modify the treatment effect. Effect modifiers (such as age, APOE-?4 genotype, pre-AMCI vs. AMCI) could 'explain' an observed treatment by site interaction. If found, we will adjust the analysis by including these effect modifiers and will then check if the treatment by site interactions can be removed.  If no explanation can be found, we will report the separate intervention effects in our primary findings.    Analytic Plan for Secondary Aims. Our secondary aims compare imaging biomarkers between metformin and placebo on an ITT basis. The analytic approach will be the same as described for the Primary Aim.	We are planning a project of 5 years duration (standard NIH R01 grant). There will be a setup period of 6 months in Year 1 to establish uniform study procedures across clinical sites including clinical and brain imaging procedures in addition to IRB application, staff training, and other regulatory requirements.  Recruitment will take 2 years at a rate of 25 subjects per month for all sites (between 2 and 3 subjects per site for 10 sites). The trial duration is 24 months per subject. We plan to have 6 months at the end for the grant for data closeout, final data review, data lock, and analyses.

Patients in the targeted TXA group will receive TXA only if TEG measurements indicate hyperfibrinolysis whereas patients in the empiric group will all receive TXA.	We will conduct a large, multicenter, open-label, noninferiority, pragmatic randomized trial of two different antifibrinolytic strategies for the treatment of adults with severe hemorrhagic injuries. The two arms are: (1) targeted TXA use in subjects with evidence of hyperfibrinolysis as demonstrated by a lysis time of  ≥ 3.0 on rapid thromboelastography (TEG) and (2) empiric TXA use (treatment not directed by TEG testing). \nRandomization will be performed using 1:1 allocation using permuted blocks within each site. Randomization sequence will be generated prior to the start of the study and will be filed using a series of numbered, opaque envelopes.  Envelopes with study arm assignment will be stored in close proximity to trauma resuscitation areas in study site EDs. Treatment allocation will be revealed to the clinical care team after eligibility for enrollment has been determined to be appropriate by asking a member of the care team to open the next sequentially numbered envelope. The number of the envelope and study arm assignment will be recorded in a log after opening the envelope. The clinical team will then be directed to use the assigned intervention arm.  Compliance with enrollment of eligible patients and study intervention will be monitored.  \nInterventional arms will be open-label and neither the subject nor the care team will be blinded to the allocated treatment assignment.  Blinding study intervention is not feasible given the differences in timing of TXA administration between study arms. However, randomization following study enrollment will help to minimize selection bias that might occur due to pre-enrollment awareness of study group assignment.\nWe will provide targeted education if <90% of eligible patients at a site are enrolled/randomized over one month.  If <80% of eligible patients are enrolled/randomized over two consecutive months, the site will be placed on monitored probation with removal of the site if enrollment/randomization does not increase to >80% within two additional months.  Study intervention cross-over between arms (i.e., use of TXA prior to TEG results after randomization to the targeted intervention arm and use of TEG-directed TXA adminstration after randomization to the empiric intervention arm) will be monitored by study personnel to ensure that at least 75% of subjects receive the intervention assisned with randomization. If <80% of study patients meet this minimum criteria over one month, targeted education to treating clinicians will be provided.  If <70% of eligible patients meet this criteria over two consecutive months, the site will be placed on monitored probation with removal of the site if >75% compliance with study intervention is not achieved within two additional months.	The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and relative safety of targeted versus empiric antifibrinolytic treatment in adults with severe hemorrhagic injuries in a large pragmatic multicenter randomized trial with the following specific aims: \nAim 1:  To test the hypothesis that targeted antifibrinolytic treatment is non-inferior in all-cause mortality at 28 days (tolerance margin of 2 percentage points) compared to empiric antifibrinolytic treatment. \n\nAim 2: To test the hypothesis that targeted antifibrinolytic treatment is superior in decreasing acute thrombosis at 28 days compared to empiric antifibrinolytic treatment.	Primary outcome: 28-day all cause mortality\nSecondary outcomes: thromboembolic events, total volume of blood products transfused in the first 48 hours of admission, hospital-free days (out of 28 days), ventilator-free days (out of 28 days), hospital length of stay	1	Inclusion Criteria\n1.

Subjects randomized to the targeted arm will have a rapid thromboelastography (TEG) conducted immediately after study enrollment. TXA will be administered only if the rapid TEG results demonstrate hyperfibrinolysis (lysis time ≥ 3.0). Subjects randomized to the empiric TXA administration will receive TXA immediately after study enrollment. For both study arms, TXA will be administered as a bolus infusion of 1000 mg iv over 10 minutes followed by maintenance infusion of 1000 mg over 8 hours.	48 months	28 days	\N	\N	Eligible subjects will be identified upon arrival in the emergency department.

These registries include clinical variables (GCS scores, vital signs, injuries) and outcome measures (mortality, hospital length of stay, blood transfusions).  We will leverage these ongoing trauma registries and the primary data sources for clinical variables and outcome measures.

424	\N	2	\N	t	Biomarkers of Brain Injury in Critically-Ill Children on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)	BEAM Study	6	With advances in technology, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe refractory heart and lung failure has quadrupled in children and increased tenfold in adults in the last 15 years. ECMO is life-saving, but costly, resource-intensive, and high-risk. Up to 30% of pediatric ECMO patients develop neurologic injury. We currently lack the ability to accurately stratify children at risk for death or disability, and to diagnose injury in subclinical phase, thus missing\nthe window for potential neuroprotective interventions. We hypothesize that circulating markers of brain injury and inflammation can assist in diagnosing difficult-to-image neurologic injury; provide real-time feedback to neuroprotective or potentially deleterious interventions in the intensive care unit; identify patients at risk for long-term neurologic disability; and serve as entry criteria and benchmarks of therapeutic efficacy in future interventional clinical trials through a more refined approach than is currently possible. Based on preliminary data from single and two-center studies, we propose a multicenter prospective observational study (9 centers, 225 subjects) that will seek to determine the association between plasma and imaging markers of brain injury and inflammation during ECMO and short and long-term survival and neurologic outcomes of critically-ill children who require extracorporeal support. Using targeted and discovery approaches, we will address our overall goal in the following specific aims, with the support and well-established research infrastructure of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group and the Kennedy Krieger Institute: (1) Determine if circulating levels of brain injury markers during ECMO and brain MRI abnormalities at 2 weeks after ECMO are associated with survival at 18 months after ECMO with a score ≥85 on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, third edition (VABS-III); (2) Determine whether the presence and degree of inflammation during ECMO and markers of neuroinflammation on brain MRS at 2 weeks after ECMO are associated with survival at 18 months after ECMO with a score ≥85 on VABS-III; (3) Determine whether metabolic and lipid neuroinflammatory pathways will distinguish between at-risk for, acute, and recovery phases of neurologic injury during ECMO.	We propose a prospective multicenter observational study of 225 children who are cannulated onto ECMO (testing cohort). The study will take advantage of existing large sample repositories from the pediatric ECMO two-center training cohort (2010-2015, 99 children, 955 samples; Aims 1 and 2) and a single-center, non-ECMO PICU control plasma repository (2010-2015, 358 children, 4988 samples collected longitudinally during the PICU admission; Aim 2).\nStudy subjects for the prospective testing cohort will be enrolled by research coordinators at each participating site within 48h of ECMO initiation. Screening will take place daily at each site's ICU(s). Families or legal guardians of eligible children will be approached for informed consent using IRB-approved documents.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

In this proposed Phase II, double-blind, placebo controlled, multisite proof-of-concept trial in subjects initiating pegloticase for treatment of chronic refractory gout we will evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of using immune modulating therapy with MMF to prevent immunogenicity conferred by pegloticase. Participants will be randomized 3:1 to either pegloticase + MMF (Peg+MMF) or to pegloticase + placebo (peg+PBO). Randomization allocation will be balanced in time and by site to achieve 40peg+MMF and 15 peg+PBO using a double-blind design. Treatment assignment will be determined by a random number generator and stratified by site using a central randomization system to ensure the 45/15 allocation.	The primary efficacy outcome endpoint is the sustained normalization of sUA to < 6 mg/dL through Week 12.

Participants who have a single sUA >6mg/dL will be allowed to continue (per the prescribing information) and will be considered a responder. If the sUA goal is not maintained before or at the 12 week mark, it will be assumed that the participant has developed clinically relevant anti-pegloticase antibody and they will receive no further infusions.Secondary endpoints will examine anti-pegloticase Ab titers/types, different definitions of sUA level and later time points (> 12 weeks) of success, and patient reported outcomes (PROs).	1	Main Inclusion Criteria is Chronic refractory gout*\n*Defined as: 1) Proven gout as defined by 2015 ACR/EULAR criteria;56 2) Evidenced of tophi or radiographic damage, 3) Failure of oral ULT (sUA > 6mg/dL) at medically appropriate dose of the xanthine oxidase inhibitors or contraindication to a urate lowering therapy (FDA indication for use of pegloticase), and 4) > 3 gout flares year or chronic gouty arthritis (continuous gout disease activity)\nMain Exclusion Criteria is G6PD deficiency (tested at Screening Visit 1), severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <25 mL/min/1.73 m2) or currently on dialysis	7 US Academic Medical Centers with population of severe gout patients.

73	2016-12-07	40	\N	\N	A MULTI-CENTER RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF TETRABIOPTERIN IN SCLERODERMA-ASSOCIATED DIGITAL ULCERS (DU)	DU Study	3	Pilot data suggest that BH4 supplementation improves endothelial function in patients with SSc, and is most effective in patients with a history of DU. Given that the risk of DU in SSc is increased with endothelial dysfunction or previous history of DU, our hypothesis is that there is therapeutic benefits of BH4 in the prevention or treatment of DU in patients with SSc.    The primary objective of this study is to provide preliminary data on the efficacy (digital ulcer net burden) of tetrabiopterin administered 10 mg/kg daily in comparison to placebo in patients with SSc.	The following evaluations will be performed, and information obtained up to 14 days before randomization and start of study drug treatment:    ? Participant information and obtaining written informed consent    ? Eligibility: Assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria     ? Provide written information on local wound care    ? Take digital picture of cardinal ulcer    ? Demographic data, including sex, race, ethnic group, year of birth, smoking history, alcohol consumption    ? Medical/surgical history    ? Prior and concomitant therapy    ? Physical examination, including height/weight    ? Vital signs. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured at all visits in sitting position after the subject has been at rest for at least 5 minutes. Same arm is always used for these measurements     ? Digital ulcer net burden assessment    ? Provide 1-week diary to participant which they will complete daily for 7 consecutive days prior to Visit 1 to document Raynaud attacks     ? Pregnancy test (urine) for all women of childbearing potential     ? Blood samples for hematology, serum chemistry    Visit 1 ?    ?Baseline (Day , Week ) - Double-Blind Treatment Phase    The following assessments will be performed at the Baseline visit (Day 0 of study drug treatment):    Before intake of study medication    ? Reconfirmation of eligibility    ? Discuss adherence with the local wound care    ? Take digital picture of the cardinal ulcer, if not taken at screening    ? Patient reported outcomes (patient global assessment, PROMIS-29, and HAQ- D1SHAQ and HDISS-DU) and physician global assessment    ? Vital signs as described above.    ? Digital ulcer net burden assessment    ? Assessment of Raynaud attacks - participant to return completed diary    ? Blood plasma sample for biomarkers to be obtained before the start of study drug treatment     ? Pregnancy test (urine) for all women of childbearing potential     ? Recording and assessment of AEs     ? Concomitant therapy    ? Randomization to study drug treatment with either riociguat or placebo    ? Dispense study drug     Visits 2 through 7 Double-blind treatment phase    At these study visits, the participant should attend the clinic without having taken the morning dose of study medication.    During dosing periods of the double-blind treatment phase (Visits 2 to 7), the following assessments will be performed according to the schedule of events     ? Physical examination at Visits 3 and 7, including weight    ? Vital signs at every visit, as described above.    ? Discuss adherence with the local wound care at every visit    ? Take digital picture of the cardinal ulcer at week 7    ? Digital ulcer net burden assessment at all visits    ? Recording and assessment of AEs at all visits    ? Pregnancy test (urine) for all women of childbearing potential at Visits 3, 5, 6, and 7    ? Hematology and serum chemistry at Visits 5 and 7    ? Patient reported outcomes (patient global assessment, PROMIS-29, HAQ- DISHAQ, and HDISS-DU) and physician global assessment at Visit 7.    ? Assessment of Raynaud's attacks - participant to be provided 1-week diary at Visit 6 and returned on Visit 7. Since the diary is only for 1 week, participant can do it for one continuous week between the 2 visits and bring it back at Visit 7.    ? Concomitant therapy at all visits    ? Dispensation of study drug (At Visit 7 if participant has active DU, Open Label drug will be dispensed if participant consents to continued participation in the study.)** Important note: Participants should not take the last dose of randomized drug the night prior to coming to the clinic for visit 7.    ? Blood plasma sample for biomarkers to be obtained before the start of study drug treatment  at Visit 7          Early Termination Visit during Double Blind    In the case of an early termination/withdrawal during double-blind period, follow the schedule of events for Visit 7. The only exception is that Raynaud's diary is not collected if it was not dispensed at least 1 week prior to early termination visit.         Unscheduled visit    Participants can be brought into clinic for an unscheduled (UNSCH) visit should they experience dose toleration issues, or other treatment related adverse events in between their regularly-scheduled visits.    During an UNSH visit, vitals, physical exam, and assessment for AE's should occur. Should a dose reduction be warranted the participant should return the previously dispensed medication bottles.  The site can then dispense a lower dose through the drug dispensing system.	As stated under objective/hypothesis, the primary objective of this study is to provide preliminary data on the efficacy (digital ulcer net burden) of tetrabiopterin administered 10 mg/kg daily in comparison to placebo in patients with SSc.    The secondary objectives of this study are to provide preliminary data on safety and additional measures of efficacy of tetrabiopterin administered 10 mg/kg daily as compared with placebo.    Additional efficacy measures including:    �         Healing of the cardinal DU. For each participant, one digital ulcer must be identified and designated by the investigator as the cardinal ulcer at Baseline.    �         Development of new DU    �         Improvement of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP)    �         Raynaud's condition score    �         Number of Raynaud's attacksday    �         Patient and physician assessment of RP; pain, numbness, and tingling during an RP attack; and duration of attacks    �         Patient's and physician's global assessment on a Likert scale    �         Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using PROMIS-29    �         Physical function as assessed by HAQ-DI    �         Safety outcomes include adverse events, clinically significant changes in vital signs, laboratory test abnormalities, and clinical tolerability of the drug.	Reduction in net digital ulcer burden.	1	Entry Criteria:    Inclusion:    �         Participants must meet the following criteria to be eligible for enrollment in the study:    �         Signed written informed consent    �         Men or women aged 18 years and older    �         Diagnosis of Systemic sclerosis, as defined by 2013 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/ European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification of SSc    �         Patients had to have at least one visible, active ischemic DU at screening located at or distal to the proximal interphalangeal joint, and that developed or worsened within 8 weeks prior to screening. NOTE: Presence of eschar will not be considered an active ulcer.    �         Females of reproductive potential (FRP) must have a negative, pre-treatment pregnancy test.      Exclusion:    Active DU related to calcinosis (as assessed by clinical examination or radiographic evaluation at screening)    �         Major surgery (including joint surgery) within 8 weeks prior to screening    �         Participants with a history of malignancy in the last 5 years other than non-melanoma skin cell cancers cured by local resection or carcinoma in situ    �         Participants with hemoglobin < 9. gdL, white blood cell (WBC) count < 3mm3 (< 3 � 19L), platelet count < 1,mm3 (< 3 � 19L) at the screening visit    �         Pregnant or breastfeeding women    �         Any other condition or therapy that would make the participant unsuitable for this study and will not allow participation for the full planned study period    �         Participation in another clinical study with an investigational drug or medical device within 3 days prior to randomization (phase I?III clinical studies)	Not provided	Oral tetrabiopterin 10 mg/kg daily for 16 weeks.	Not provided	Not provided	\N	The planned sample size of 30 SSc participants is based on practical considerations to obtain preliminary estimates of the magnitude of treatment differences in efficacy and safety rather than a desired power for a pre- specified difference as would be necessary for a confirmatory study. However, with this proposed sample of 30 participants (15 tetrabiopterin and 15 placebo), we can calculate the magnitude of treatment differences (tetrabiopterin - placebo) for the primary efficacy endpoint - the change from baseline to end of double- blind treatment in digital ulcer net burden (a continuous endpoint), or safety outcomes - characterized by the proportion of participants who experience an AE. There would be 80% power to detect an effect size (mean treatment difference divided by standard deviation) of 1.253 or greater with a two-sided type I error of 5% in the primary endpoint. Given the pilot nature of this Phase IIa study, the difference between mean change in digital ulcer net burden between tetrabiopterin and placebo that can be detected with sufficient power is large. Similarly, we can calculate power for safety outcomes for this sample size: there is 81% power to detect treatment differences of 51%. Descriptive statistics will be derived for all clinical variables, mean and standard deviation for continuous outcomes and percentages for categorical and dichotomous variables. The main outcome of interest is the mean change in digital ulcer net burden at the end of 16 weeks in the two groups. We will compare the mean change in the tetrabiopterin vs. placebo groups using an ANCOVA model, with treatment and baseline digital ulcer net burden as covariates. Extension of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to adjust for baseline digital ulcer net burden will be used if the assumptions of the parametric ANCOVA model are violated. We will also compare the proportion of patients with healing of the cardinal DU, the mean change in DU from baseline to week 16, the number of new DUs during the study, new ulcers or healing of ulcers, and the change in patient- reported outcomes (PROs) including Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) measures and global assessments by the patient and physician in the tetrabiopterin vs. placebo group using similar methods as used for the primary endpoint for continuous outcomes and Fisher's exact tests for discrete outcomes.    The p-values resulting from formal statistical tests will be interpreted from a hypothesis-generating, rather than a confirmatory framework.	Include a general description of enrollment plans and potential strategies to address potential challenges.  Include summary information such as data regarding subject availability, and projected timelines for enrollment, subject accrual period, and follow up to study completion. Based on other enrolling DU trials we anticipate no challenges.

480	2019-03-21	20	\N	t	Effects of acute and chronic aerobic and resistance exercise on insulin sensitivity in MoTrPAC	MoTrPAC Insulin Sensitivity	6	This study will measure changes in insulin sensitivity before and after both acute and chronic aerobic and resistance exercise training in the MoTrPAC study. Our specific working hypothesis is that a single bout of exercise and chronic exercise training will decrease specific molecular species of sphingolipids within skeletal muscle linked with enhanced insulin sensitivity. More broadly, we hypothesize that acute exercise will reveal unique early transcriptomics, lipidomics and post translational modification, e.g., phosphoproteome responses not observed with chronic exercise responses, and that these molecular responses will be associated with acute exercise-induced enhancements in insulin sensitivity.	This study is an ancillary study to the MoTrPAC parent study, which is a 12 week exercise training intervention study. Subjects will be randomized to either resistance training, aerobic training, or control. There will also be a highly trained athlete group that is tested acutely but does not go through exercise training. Subjects will not be blinded for obvious reasons but all the analyses performed will be done blinded.	The objective of aim 1 is to quantify insulin sensitivity after a single bout of acute aerobic and resistance exercise in humans, and link these changes to the molecules that will be measured in MoTrPAC. \n\nThe objective of aim 2 is to quantify insulin sensitivity before and after chronic aerobic and resistance exercise training in humans, and link these changes to the molecules that will be measured in MoTrPAC in response to exercise training.	Primary endpoints are the change in insulin sensitivity from basal to post acute exercise, and from basal to post chronic exercise.	1	Willingness to provide informed consent to participate in the MoTrPAC Study\n Must be able to read and speak English well enough to provide informed consent and\nunderstand instructions\n Aged≥18y\n BMI>19to<35kg/m2\n Sedentary defined as self-reporting no more than 1 day per week of regular (structured) EE [e.g., brisk walking, jogging/running, cycling, elliptical, or swimming activity that results in feelings of increased heart rate or rapid breathing (EE), and/or sweating] or RE (resulting in muscular fatigue) that on average lasts no more than 60 minutes in the past year\no Persons bicycling as a mode of transportation to/from work > 1 day/week etc. are not considered sedentary\no Leisure walkers are included unless they meet the heart rate, breathing and sweating criteria noted above\no Persons adherent to both 1 day/week of RE and 1 day/week of EE are excluded	Sites involved in this study are University of Colorado, University of Texas San Antonio, University of Texas Galveston, East Carolina University, Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes, Florida Hospital, Duke University	Aerobic or resistance exercise 3-4x/week for 45-60 minutes	60 months	5 months	\N	\N	\N
216	2017-10-19	40	\N	\N	The genetic basis for cardiovascular disease in Turner syndrome	The genetic basis for cardiovascular disease in Turner syndrome	6	Turner syndrome (TS) is caused by loss of the female second sex chromosome. Systemic hypertension, aortic dissection/rupture, ischemic heart disease and stroke are much more common in TS then the general population. We hypothesize that in TS there is a nexus between aortic compliance and systemic hypertension causing cardiovascular disease, aortopathy in particular. We will identify hypertension using 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, measure aortic compliance using echocardiography and identify critical genes using whole exome sequencing (WES). An understanding of the X-linked genetic mechanisms in TS will hopefully shed light on common cardiovascular conditions of the general population	Subjects for this cross-sectional case-control genotype-phenotype correlation study are identified from record review of three existing datasets: the GenTAC study, the PI's Healthy Heart Study and the Turner Syndrome Research Registry.  The lead study coordinator at OHSU will arrange enrollment/consent and transportation to the closest of five regional study sites. Regional coordinators will collect demographic and other pertinent data and navigate subjects to local testing sites (years 1-3). The on-site coordinators will arrange for transmission of raw data to the Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Echocardiographic core center in Cincinnati and to OHSU for final analysis after WES (Year 4).	Overall objective: To determine the genetic basis of essential hypertension in Turner syndrome. High blood pressure is the most treatable cause of aortic dissection and rupture in young women with TS. We hypothesize that a rigorous phenotypic definition of hypertension that incorporates arterial compliance will improve identification of the genetic factors associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease in Turner syndrome. \n\nObjective1: To identify hypertension among 378 girls and women using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). ABMP is considered the gold standard to determine hypertensive load. We will study cases that have evidence of hypertension and normotensive controls from the GenTAC cohort, The PI's Healthy Heart Project and from the Turner Syndrome Research Registry\n\nObjective 2.\tTo measure aortic deformability by quantifying aortic stiffness, distensibility, strain and pulse wave velocity using transthoracic echocardiography.\n\nObjective 3.\tTo identify genes involved in the pathogenesis of systemic hypertension by comparing hypertensive/non-compliant aorta cases with normotensive/compliant aorta control subjects using WES.	The primary endpoint of this study is the identification of genes that correlate with the deep phenotype of decreased vascular compliance and systemic hypertension. Candidate genes include the TIMP/MMP family of based on our preliminary data. There are no secondary endpoints specifically addressed in the study protocol.  However, a variety of beneficial outcome endpoints are anticipated including:\n\n1.\tExtensive phenotyping coupled with genomic characterization provides a unique resource for the TS community. Rigorous and well-defined phenotypes are a key factor in successful genotype-phenotype studies of complex traits. The level of characterization proposed here not only improves the power of this study but will also increase the impact for secondary analysis for other TS and cardiovascular studies. Those participating in the five regional study sites will cultivate a translational science workforce that will specifically benefit the TS community.\n2.\tAn understanding of the genetic basis for the TS aortopathy will lead to novel treatments. The frequent morbid events and appalling excess of premature deaths in TS demands a search for new treatment to slow or halt the progression of aortopathy, possibly through manipulation of MMP/TIMP action (for example doxycycline can increase TIMP expression).\n3.\tProof that genetically-triggered aortic stiffness leads to systemic hypertension would be the basis for innovative research in the field. Endothelial dysfunction in small vessels acquired with age is thought to be the major cause of essential hypertension. However, hypertension is common and aortic compliance is decreased in children with TS well before age-related factors such as atherosclerosis and chronic kidney disease set in, suggesting that genetic and early developmental factor are responsible. The studies proposed in this protocol will test the novel hypothesis that genes involved in the TS vasculopathy leading to decreased aortic wall compliance are the root cause of essential hypertension. \n4.\tThese studies will foster the idea that Turner syndrome is a human model to understand the role of the sex chromosomes in the differential susceptibility to common disease. The non-TS 4-core mouse model that segregates gonadal sex from chromosomal sex has shown that blood pressure may be, in part, due to X-linked genes that play no role in sexual differentiation (estrogen effects). Yet a major impediment to the understanding of cardiovascular disease in TS is the absence of a mouse model that recapitulates the human cardiovascular phenotype and the TS aortopathy in particular. Dr. David Page has hypothesized that protein function dosage-sensitive genes on the X chromosome that escape inactivation may play a role in diverse disease processes outside the reproductive tract. The experiments proposed in this application will test this novel hypothesis in a human population where gene dosage is uniquely linked to sex chromosome expression. Thus, our proposed work supports the initiative by the NIH to focus on the role of sex chromosomes in health and disease.	3	Exclusion criteria: history of aortic aneurysm repair and/or replacement, history of chronic renal disease, aortic surgery including coarctation surgery to exclude non-genetic etiologies of hypertension and abnormal compliance, any kidney disease, or abnormal creatinine (measured at enrollment). \n\nInclusion criteria: Karyotype proven TS. Available preliminary BP data and ability to undergo ABPM	Our lead study coordinator will arrange transportation to the closest of five regional study sites (Portland OR, Houston TX, Cincinnati OH, Cornell NY, or Baltimore MD).  The PI is a member of the GenTAC consortium, a group of five institutions coordinated by NHLBI dedicated to understanding the genetic basis of triggered aortic diseases and related conditions.  We have already recruited collaborators who are members of the consortium to oversee site coordination.  In addition, the GenTAC consortium has developed coordinators at each of our sites over the last 10 years.  These same experienced individuals will participate in this project.  The on-site coordinators will collect demographic and other pertinent data, and will navigate subjects to various testing centers (blood draw for basic metabolic panel including creatinine, echocardiogram, and ABPM placement).	This is cross-sectional case-control genotype-phenotype correlation study. Therefore, the study is primarily observational and no intervention with drug, biologic, or device is planned.  Subjects will answer a short questionnaire, provide blood samples, and undergo ABPM and echocardiography.	Study duration is 48 months.  Our overall strategy during months 1-36 of the project is to deeply phenotype subjects (objective 1 & 2) in order to effectively segregate cases and controls for subsequent WES experiments and analyses during months 37-48 (objective 3.)	Study participants will be asked to travel to region study sites for a single visit that will take approximately 4 days (.13 months)	\N	Objective 1: Exploratory Data analysis (EDA) to assess distributional assumptions, identify outliers and determine if transformation or nonparametric methods are warranted. Descriptive statistics will be as means ± standard deviation for continuous variables and frequency and % for categorical variables. Continuous outcomes will be compared between hypertension cases and normotensive controls using linear modeling and categorical variables will be analyzed by Chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical data, as appropriate. Propensity scores will be calculated using multivariable logistic regression with demographic (age) and clinical covariates to calculate propensity (probability) of being in the hypertension group. \n\nObjective 2: Subjects will be analyzed similarly for their propensity to be in the non-compliant aorta group. Each hypertensive/non-compliant subject will be matched to up to 3 normotensive/compliant control patients with similar propensity scores using optimal matching to reduce bias due to differences between groups. Aortic distensibility and stiffness will be modeled on the matched pairs using multivariable linear regression to measure the differences between groups. We will replicate these analyses within sections of the aorta to compare aortic distensibility and stiffness within that section. Multivariable linear regression model will be utilized to measure the strength of the relationships of age, blood pressure, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic size on aortic distensibility and stiffness. \n\nObjective 3: To enhance the probability of identifying an exome-wide significant signal a gene-based burden test, the optimal sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O), will be used to evaluate the data. This analysis clusters all variants into genes for a gene by phenotype analysis, which improves signal strength for exome data from smaller cohorts as it reduces the multiple testing burden. This state-of-the-art approach is particularly useful for studies of rare disorders such as Turner syndrome. The variants which pass QC from the WES pipeline will be assigned to their respective genes using hg19_refGene. Variants will be allowed to be in more than one gene since the test compares gene burden in the same gene, not between different genes. All analyses will include the first three principal component eigenvalues as covariates to adjust for any underlying population structure. First, SKAT-O will be used to test for an association with the dichotomous hypertension status. Second, SKAT-O will be used to test for an association with hypertension/non-compliant aorta. For each analysis, a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot will be generated to look for departure of the observed p-values from the expected p-values.	\N

This is a prospective pilot study whose primary aim is to determine whether investigational FLT imaging can detect and distinguish nonengraftment from delayed engraftment after HSCT in populations at highest risk for graft failure. The investigators will enroll 50 patients undergoing myeloblative transplantation on this trial (15 pediatric and adult recipients of cord blood stem cells, 15 pediatric and adult recipients of haplo-identical HSCT, and 20 recipients of these two stem cell sources who have not engrafted by day 28). The planned length of this trial is 5 years and it will be conducted at 3 centers.	Primary Objective: \nFLT SUV identifies graft failure [ Time Frame: 24-28 days ]\nTo calculate if SUV > 1.2 identifies subclinical engraftment using FLT PET/CT imaging for recipients of cord and haplo-HSCT who have not engrafted within 24 days of HSCT.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures  :\nMap subclinical engraftment in alternative donor HSCT [ Time Frame: Day -1 to Day 28 after HSCT ]\nUse SUV increase in particular medullary spaces to identify the first site of marrow settling after HSCT in alternative donor HSCT\n\nTK1 serum levels identify graft failure [ Time Frame: 24-28 days ]\nCalculate if TK1 level increases correlate with clinical engraftment\n\nNumber of patients with CTCAE version 5 events exceeding grade 3 that are possibly, probably, or definitely attributed to the FLT imaging [ Time Frame: Day -1 to Day 28 after HSCT ]\nSafety of FLT in alternative donor HSCT - Calculate the number of patients with CTCAE version 5 events exceeding grade 3 that are possibly, probably, or definitely attributed to the FLT imaging\n\nOther cytokine and chemokine markers of graft failure [ Time Frame: 24-28 days ]\nExplore other cellular, cytokine, and chemokine markers of subclinical engraftment	1) detection of nonengraftment with FLT and TK1, 2) development of a model that predicts nonengraftment versus delayed engraftment using FLT and TK1, 3) sensitivity of individual biomarkers to distinguish between graft failure and delayed engraftment, and 4) biology of cord blood and haplo-HSCT engraftment.	3	General Inclusion Criteria:\n4 to 60 years of age\nAble to perform FLT imaging without anesthesia\nDiagnosed with a condition for which myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is standard of care and HSCT is planned\nIn morphologic remission prior to HSCT\nPatient or guardian able to give informed consent\nNo investigational therapies within past 28 days Karnofsky or Lansky performance status >60%\nAdditional specific criteria for Arms A and B\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n* History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent\n\nClinically significant systemic illness with manifestations of significant organ dysfunction which, in the judgment of the PI or Co-I, would render the patient unlikely to tolerate the protocol therapy or complete the study\nPresence of active malignancy from an organ system other than hematopoietic\nPregnant or lactating females\nPatients who are unable or unwilling to use effective form(s) of contraception during the course of the study\nPrior history of fluorothymidine allergy or intolerance	The trial will be conducted at 3 centers: Children's National Medical Center (pediatric), University of Oklahoma (pediatric and adult), and University of Michigan (pediatric and adult).

485	2019-03-26	20	\N	t	Improving Clostridioides difficile Diagnostics and Treatment in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant	CDI in HCT	4	Randomized phase 3 trial centered around C diff infection (CDI) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) with the hypotheses that (a) many HCT patients with diarrhea who test positive for CDI may actually just be colonized with CDI and have diarrhea for other reasons (e.g. chemotherapy) and may not need treatment, and (b) fidaxomicin (being a narrower spectrum antibiotic) would result in less damage to the microbiome and less GVHD than oral vancomycin.	Randomized phase 3 trial with two randomizations: in the first stage, all patients (autologous and allogeneic HCT patients) with a positive C diff PCR test and high cycle threshold (CT) will get randomized to treatment vs. watchful waiting (hypothesis: those with high CT have low disease burden and likely are colonized by C diff but have diarrhea from other causes, e.g. chemo); those with persistent diarrhea after 72 hours or meet clinical criteria may cross over to receive treatment. For the second randomization, allogeneic HCT patients who receive treatment (would stratify by (a) PCR pos, CT low, all receive treatment; (b) PCR pos, CT high, randomized to treatment; (c) PCR pos, CT high, randomized to no treatment but crossover to receive treatment) would be randomized to oral vancomycin vs. fidaxomicin with the hypothesis that fidaxomicin (being narrower spectrum) would cause less disruption to the microbiome and less graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)	Grant aims below; protocol not yet written:\n\n1. Reduce CDI overdiagnosis and overtreatment by combining polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with cycle threshold (CT). Most centers use PCR to test for CDI, which has high sensitivity but cannot differentiate non-infectious diarrhea in a patient colonized with C. difficile (e.g. diarrhea due to chemotherapy) from toxin-mediated diarrhea, potentially leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. However, modern PCR machines now provide information on both PCR positivity as well as CT, which has been shown to be associated with C. difficile severity and toxin production (i.e. CDI). We hypothesize that patients who are PCR positive with high CT are C. difficile carriers who do not need treatment and propose a multicenter randomized clinical trial of CDI treatment vs. watchful waiting for these patients. For safety, patients who meet Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) criteria for fulminant CDI will be excluded; in addition, those in the watchful waiting arm with otherwise unexplained persistent diarrhea after 72 hours will be initiated on treatment. Endpoints include need for CDI treatment in the watchful waiting group (primary endpoint) and, in both groups, incidence of severe CDI, time to diarrhea resolution, need for admission and hospital length of stay, transplant length of stay, graft-versus-host disease, treatment-related mortality, and overall survival. Diagnostic stool samples from both arms will also be kept for centralized toxin testing to compare with PCR and CT results.\n\n2. Evaluate the impact of oral vancomycin vs. fidaxomicin on CDI and HCT outcomes. Most centers in the US, including the five participating centers, use oral vancomycin for first-line treatment of CDI; however, oral vancomycin introduces profound, long-lasting devastation to the commensal microbiota, which may be responsible for the increased rates of GVHD in patients after CDI. Fidaxomicin is a new antibiotic that has a narrower spectrum, which may induce less disruption to the microbiome, potentially decreasing GVHD and other complications after HCT. We propose a randomized phase 3 open label clinical trial of fidaxomicin vs. oral vancomycin for treatment of CDI in HCT patients with the hypothesis that patients in the fidaxomicin group will have less acute GVHD (primary endpoint) those with oral vancomycin. Other endpoints include duration of diarrhea, CDI severity, CDI resolution, CDI recurrence, chronic GVHD, TRM, length of stay, admissions, and quality of life and other patient reported outcomes. Please see attached letter of support from Merck, which will provide fidaxomicin free of charge for this study if funded.\n\n3.

We will create novel testing procedures designed specifically for children and incorporate mechanisms to ensure unprecedented levels of scientific rigor, reproducibility, and interoperability in laboratory and field assessments. Exercise and physical activity biomarkers [laboratory-based cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and field assessments of habitual physical activity (HPA)] provide insights into health status and disease mechanisms that are often hidden when the child is at rest. Despite the promise of these disease-agnostic tools, physical activity-related outcome variables have yet to be optimally embedded in the clinical research repertoire in child health. The aims  are: 1) to develop new protocols for CPET that are specifically designed for children both in health and disease, 2) to quantify the link between laboratory CPET and field assessments of HPA and, in so doing, open new ways to merge health assessments made in schools and community with primary care child health providers, and 3) to build on Aims 1 and 2 and to incorporate promising tools of systems biology (e.g., omics, flow cytometry) into studies focused on exercise, disease, and health in children during critical periods of growth and development. CPET in children is based on century-old biological concepts of identifying maximal efforts at the extreme limits of physiological exercise capacity (V?O2max). Although this approach immeasurably advanced the field of clinical exercise testing in adults, the classically defined V?O2max is not achieved in the majority of CPET in children. We propose to exploit a unique advantage of CPET challenges, namely, that the perturbation (the 'input') can be measured in thermo-dynamically incontrovertible units (i.e., watts). We will use this feature to design tests that mimic naturally occurring exercise in children. Advances in wearable accelerometry permit accurate measures of HPA in children and adolescents with disease and disability, and we will measure CPET and HPA in the same participants. We have targeted use-cases that represent formidable challenges in physical activity and fitness assessment: healthy children (pediatric origins of adult disease); sickle cell anemia (chronic inflammation and hemodynamic impairment), and survivors of pediatric cancer (increased risk for physical inactivity health impairments). We will study cohorts prospectively over Tanner 2-5, roughly a 3-4 year interval, a dynamic period of growth during which gene expression is changing spontaneously, body weight can increase by as much as 50%, and growth factors like IGF-1 double. Our team includes three CTSAs (UC Irvine, UCLA, and Northwestern University) and collaboration with the North American Society of Pediatric Exercise Medicine and the American College of Sports Medicine. This collaboration will produce a unique set of data and best practices that will be shared and disseminated among child health researchers and care providers, and will stimulate the development of clinical trials in which CPET and HPA are selected as key outcome variables.	We will enroll 20 sickle cell patients, 20 children who survived malignancies, and 20 healthy children, all in the Tanner 2-3 developmental stage, at each of the two sites (UCI and Northwestern). Each participant will undergo a series of exercise tests as outlined in Table 1. These studies are described in greater detail in the Clinical Protocol Synopsis (CPS). We have designed the study much like a multicenter clinical trial would be organized, but at a smaller scale. Our focus is on the process of data collection, centralized analysis, harmonization, rigor, and reproducibility rather than on specific clinical outcomes. Each use-case represents a unique challenge: in healthy children, how do we identify levels of fitness that place the child at inordinate risk for threats to the healthspan later  in life; in sickle cell anemia, can we determine an optimal level of fitness despite the chronic inflammation and anemia that constrain the physiological adjustments to acute exercise; and  in children who have survived malignancies, can we detect early impairments of physical fitness that could serve as noninvasive biomarkers to gauge the impact of a specific exercise intervention or a broader but concerted effort to effect a change in lifestyle.    Table 1. Annual Testing Schedule. Sixty children at Tanner 2-3 (50/50 male-female) will be enrolled in years 1-2 at UCI and Northwestern (20 without history of chronic disease or condition; 20 with SCA; 20 cancer survivors).

Primary Objectives    1.   Pilot test new analytic strategies for traditional CPET and develop novel protocols (MBEB, multiple brief exercise bouts) for laboratory-based CPET that are specifically designed for children both in health and in disease. These approaches are designed to be used across a wide range of child health and lifespan translational research and clinical practice.    2.   Quantify the link between laboratory CPET and field assessments of habitual physical activity (HPA).    Secondary Objectives    1.   Improve protocol and data interoperability in CPET and HPA focused on child health.    2.

Incorporate promising tools of systems biology (e.g., omics, flow cytometry) into CPET and HPA protocols in child health translational research.    2.

Each site will enroll 20 healthy    children (who will also serve as a descriptive control), 20 children with sickle cell anemia, and 20 children who    have survived childhood cancers (acute lymphocytic leukemia, solid tumors, etc.) who are deemed by their    primary health care providers as capable of performing CPET. The participants will be enrolled at the Tanner    2-3 pubertal stage with a 50/50 ratio of male/female.

Exercise is performed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer. Each participant begins by cycling at 0 W (unloaded) work rate with a brief warm-up phase. The work rate is then continuously incremented in a linear ramp pattern. The ramp slope (the increase in work rate per time) is determined based on the child's age and maturational status, and a subjective estimate of his/her level of fitness with the goal that the test will last between 5 and 12 minutes. Throughout the test, study staff actively encourage the participants who are asked to raise their hand when they reach the limit of their tolerance. A servomechanism in the electronic braking system of the ergometer maintains the input work to an accuracy of 1% within a range of pedaling rates of 50-90 rpm. We can also perform CPET using treadmills located in our center, in which the incline and speed of the treadmill are calculated to mimic a ramp-type work rate input (4). The subjects breathe through low-resistance valves. Ventilation (V?E), CO2 production (V?CO2), and O2 uptake (V?O2) are measured breath-by-breath. HR is measured continuously and BP every 4 minutes automatically. When the test is complete, we then identify the peak V?O2 calculated as the maximum of 20-second averages (moving average of every 6 seconds) over the last 2 minutes of exercise. There is currently no validated, universally accepted respiratory exchange ratio (RER, V?CO2/ V?O2) cutoff in children for the determination of peak VO2. We use RER ?1.1, a criterion used in a large study by Rowland et al. (5). From the WR, HR, and gas exchange measurements obtained during CPET, the submaximal slopes are calculated using standard linear regression (6). The slopes are proving to be useful adjuncts to traditional CPET peak or maximal values (see Figure 7 in Research Strategy).         2. MBEB-CPET DEVELOPMENT AND ANALYSIS    As noted in the Research Strategy Plan, we developed MBEB to simultaneously test systemic and circulating biomarker responses to exercise using protocols that were fun for children and more closely mimicked natural patterns of physical activity. MBEB has the potential to reveal much more of the integrated biological responses necessary for children to engage in habitual physical activity than do traditional maximal tests. The bulk of physical activity in children does not consist of sustained heavy exercise, rather, as shown in Figures 8 and 9 in the Research Strategy section, frequently changing bouts of exercise of varying intensity. This type of metabolic perturbation requires the organism to: 1) rapidly adjust to the sudden imposition of increased metabolic demand, 2) rapidly recover from the perturbation so that the next exercise bout can occur quickly, and 3) signal longer term cellular adaptive mechanisms that will minimize the threat to homeostasis imposed by future physical activity (the training response).         We propose a dynamic, multivariable approach to analyze MBEB where fitness is described as the ability of primary physiological processes to meet the demands of an exercise task that is changing in magnitude. The project PIs and coinvestigators have extensive experience in modeling kinetic gas exchange and heart rate (HR) responses to exercise in both children and adults. To identify the dynamic characteristics of the primary physiological processes (e.g. heart rate, gas exchange and ventilation) to MBEB, we will use 'white box' modeling (where the parameters are known a priori) such as in the following equation, a simple approximation of the on-transient kinetics:    y(t) = y0 + ?y � [1-e-t/t]    and 'grey box' system identification procedures (7,8) with exogenous inputs (where some parameters are identified a priori, and others are identified by the fitting procedure). We will characterize three parameters: the time constant (t), gain, and rate of inefficiency development of each primary system. A characteristic of high-intensity exercise is a progressive inefficiency (the 'slow component'), which is time- and intensity-dependent and challenges the body's ability to achieve a steady-state (9-12). We have previously identified, in adults, the intramuscular mechanisms to which these parameters relate (13). By quantifying these parameters, we will provide novel measures of physical fitness that quantify the ability of multiple physiological systems to meet the demands of fluctuating sub-maximal energy demands, thereby mimicking the natural behavior of physical activity in children.         3. OMICS AND BIOMARKER STUDIES    In an exploratory study, 60 participants annually (randomly selected from among the 3 cohorts) will have blood draws before and immediately after the MBEB exercise test. Participants are asked to arrive at the laboratory by 8 AM in a fasted state. Following placement of an intravenous catheter and obtaining a fasting blood sample for insulin, glucose, and lipid screen, the participants are given a light breakfast. Blood is sampled before and after the MBEB test. The UC Irvine PERC has a great deal of experience in measuring circulating exercise biomarkers and in flow cytometry analysis of leukocyte subtypes, gene expression, and epigenetic (microRNA) expression using this type of test in both adults and children (14-17).         4. HABITUAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY    4.1. Actigraphy. Habitual physical activity (HPA) will be measured using the ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer (ActiGraph Corporation, Pensacola FL). The ActiGraph is a small (4.6 x 3.3 x 1.5 cm), light-weight (19 g) motion sensor designed to detect time varying accelerations between � 6 g at a user-specified sampling frequency ranging between 30 and 100 Hz. Concurrent validity studies utilizing heart rate monitoring (18), direct observation (19), indirect calorimetry (20,21), whole room calorimetry (22), and DLW (23) have demonstrated the ActiGraph monitor to be a valid measure of physical activity intensity and energy expenditure in children and adolescents.  Contra-lateral hip studies and sophisticated technical reliability studies using laboratory apparatus have shown the ActiGraph to have high levels of intra- and inter-unit reliability (24).         Monitors will be worn on the hip or the non-dominant wrist. After receiving detailed instructions regarding the care and use of the monitors, participants will be instructed to wear the ActiGraph for seven consecutive days.  At the time of distribution, participants will be given a 7-day log sheet to record the times the monitor was taken on and off and to provide information about any physical activity performed while the monitor was not worn (i.e., swimming). Upon return of the monitor to the laboratory, the accelerometer data will be uploaded to a Visual Basic macro written by our project Consultant Dr. Trost for determination of non-wear periods and daily time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, and moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) physical activity. Activity counts recorded on the hip monitor will be classified into these intensity categories using the cut-points developed by Evenson et al. (25), which Dr. Trost has shown to be the most accurate of all currently available cut-points for youth (26).  For hip or wrist data, the duration of specific activity types representing sedentary behavior (i.e. sitting) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (i.e. brisk walking, running) will be quantified using the neural network activity classifier developed by Dr. Trost and colleagues (27).         4.2. Machine Learning Approach to Accelerometer Data Reduction. Pattern recognition or machine learning is an emerging approach to accelerometer data reduction that promises to significantly improve device-based measurement of physical activity and sedentary behavior. Pattern recognition is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with classifying or describing observations. Widely used in business, robotics, medicine, and engineering, the goal of pattern recognition is to predict future outcomes based on previous knowledge or recognizable features in the raw data. Dr. Trost has shown that standard supervised learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees (28), Artificial Neural Networks (27), Support Vector Machines (29), and Regularized Logistic Regression (30), provide highly accurate predictions of activity type and intensity. The energy expenditure prediction errors associated with these models are 25% to 50% smaller in magnitude than those obtained with regression-based cut-point methods.         5. DUAL X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA) MEASURE OF BODY COMPOSITION    Both UCI and Northwestern will use Hologic Discovery DXA. We have used DXA in pediatric research studies since 2002. Several thousand research DXAs have been successfully performed in over one thousand children and adolescents and approximately 300 infants leading to a number of research publications (6,31). In a comparison of DXA and MRI, Bridge et al. (32) followed a group of 8-11 y.o. boys and girls and repeated the studies 26 and 48 months later. They concluded, 'this study validates the common use of DXA in monitoring change in body composition and supports ongoing use in this role in both clinical and research studies.'	Not provided.

None, in may long career, no drug company ever thought that our work merited a trip to Hawaii or its equivalent...:(	AN EXPLORATORY STATISTICAL APPROACH     A major goal of this research is to provide the child health translational research community with data that can be used to design future clinical trials that utilize CPET and HPA. This will be led by the PERC biostatistician Annamarie Stehli.    �Reproducibility. Peak values will be collected at each traditional CPET, and mixed model analysis will be used to calculate the submaximal slopes, accounting for within-subject correlation. Within-repetition distributions of each outcome will be described for each cohort (healthy, sickle cell anemia, cancer survivor) with means and standard deviations. Reproducibility analyses will be conducted within each cohort evaluating the CPET and MBEB variables in year 1. Repeated measures analysis will be performed comparing the means from the first and second repetitions, and interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) will be calculated. Power analyses (based on existing PERC data) conducted using G*power (167) indicate that for the repeated measures analyses within each cohort and across site, 34 participants are required per use-group for effect size of f=0.25 at 80% power.    �Cohort differences. We will explore differences of CPET among the cohorts. Two regression models will be run for each primary CPET outcome: 1) a model to compare the sickle cell group to the healthy controls and 2) a model to compare the cancer survivor group to the healthy controls. Published data from our Coinvestigator Dr. Robert Liem have shown significant differences between SCA patients and controls in a variety of CPET variables (137). These differences translate to large effect sizes (ranging from 1.2 to 1.5). Having 40 SCA participants per group in this study will yield 80% power to detect effect sizes as small as d= 0.55 (moderate) and greater than 95% power to detect differences larger than d=0.75. Similarly, having 20 participants per cohort at each site will yield the same power to detect moderate and large effect sizes, respectively, including an interaction effect.  Differences in main outcomes by site, gender, age, and Tanner score will be evaluated, and accounted for in analyses where appropriate. Hochberg's false discovery rate will be used to account for multiple comparisons (168).    �Prospective changes in HPA and CPET. This study will provide us the unique opportunity to prospectively evaluate CPET and HPA over a critical period of growth in child health and disease. Multilevel models will be used to evaluate trajectories of primary outcomes over the 3-4 year study period. These models will be used to assess: 1) group differences in the observed response (group effect), 2) changes in the degree of response over time (time effect), and 3) potential differences in outcome trajectories between the three groups (group by time effect). Sex and age will be included as covariates. Power analysis using RMASS for multilevel models indicates recruiting a total of 54 participants per site (18 in each cohort per site) is required to have 85% power to detect a group by time interaction effect of 0.4 or greater (taking attrition into account and expecting an intercorrelation coefficient of at least 0.5).     �Linking HPA and CPET. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, range) will be calculated for the CPET and HPA variables. Crude bivariate associations will be explored with Pearson or Spearman correlations. ANOVA and ANCOVA will be used to compare CPET and HPA in groups defined by sex, age, and study cohort. Linear and non-linear regression models will be used to assess the independent associations between HPA (specifically, time in moderate to vigorous PA-MVPA, sedentary time, and CPET. Additionally, the relationship between HPA and CPET categories will be evaluated using binary or multinomial logistic regression. All regression models will initially include all informative 2-way and 3-way interaction terms and, where appropriate, age, sex, maturation status, fat mass, birth weight, and accelerometer wear time as covariates.	\N

Obstacles coincide with processes that we are trying to innovate in the Trial Innovation Network. He has 20+ sites, most of which are CTSA affiliated sites, and getting IRB approval and contracts in place (using our TIC as well as the other TICs in the process of implementing these tasks) is going to happen anyway - prioritizing these tasks in the context of this study will have no marginal cost. Provides opportunity to execute and utilize MCTA and SMART IRB with these largely CTSA institutions. By collecting detailed performance metrics about protocol development, completion of the IND, creation of the database, and time to first patient accrual, we will be able to quantify the benefit of having TIC intervention before a funding decision is made, but after a reasonable score has been obtained.

We hypothesize that a trial of risk-based screening will 1) be an improvement over annual screening; be as safe and less morbid 2) enable more prevention; and 3) be a participant centered alternative to annual screening, readily accepted by women.This study has two primary objectives: to determine if risk-based screening is: \n\n1. Non-inferior to annual screening for late-stage cancers detected, and \n2. Whether it results in fewer biopsies	This study is a pragmatic, preference-tolerant randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the safety and morbidity of risk based screening versus an annual screening strategy. \nThis trial will take place at all Athena Breast Health Network sites, including UCSF, UCD, UCLA, UCSD, UCI and Stanford Health System.  We will also be recruiting women who do not receive their care at an Athena Breast Health Network site during the second phase of the study, and refer to these as 'virtual' site participants.\nAfter education about the study, participants will be asked to choose between randomization or self-assignment. Women who consent to randomization will be enrolled and randomized equally between the two arms- annual screening and risk-based screening.  Randomization will be stratified by site [UCSF, UCI, UCLA, UCD, UCSD, Sanford, virtual site] and Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium risk score (3 categories) to ensure similar population distributions in the two arms.  All participants in the annual screening arm will be assigned an annual screening schedule unless they are identified as being at highest risk according to the BCSC model or previously known genetic factors (see Section 5.2.2). Those identified as being at highest risk in the annual screening arm will follow standard of care that may include more frequent screening.  All participants in the risk-based screening arm will be assigned a screening schedule according to their risk assessment.

Therefore, this study has two co-primary endpoints, one to quantify safety and one to quantify morbidity.  Safety is measured by the rate of cancers diagnosed at stage IIB or higher. Morbidity is measured by the rate of breast biopsy. This trial will be considered a success if the risk based screening approach is found to be non-inferior to the annual screening approach in terms of safety and superior to the annual screening approach in terms of morbidity.  \n\n\t6.1.2 Secondary Outcomes\n•\tRate of stage IIB and interval cancers (see glossary)\n•\tRates of systemic therapy\n•\tRecall rates and follow-up procedures\n•\tRates of DCIS\n•\tRates of chemoprevention \n•\tProportion of women who agree to enroll into the study that choose risk based versus annual screening in the self-assigned cohort versus opting to be randomized\n•\tAdherence to the assigned screening schedule in the randomized cohort\n•\tPROMIS anxiety score\n•\tBreast Cancer Risk Worry	1	4.2 Inclusion Criteria \na)\tFemale\nb)\tAge 40 years to 74 years old\nc)\tPrior mammogram within the last 2 years (BIRADS 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4), or mammogram completed upon joining the study \nd)\tCoverage by a participating insurer\ne)\tReceive breast screening at an Athena site (UCSF, UCSD, UCD, UCLA, UCI, Sanford: for the first phase of the study); expansion to other medical care providers in phase 2\n4.3 Exclusion Criteria\na)\tPrior Breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosis\nb)\tInability to provide consent \nc)\tNon-English proficiency (plans to expand to Spanish by year 2)	6 medical centers are participating in the WISDOM study: UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego, UC San Francisco, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and Stanford Medical Health Centers (across Midwest region)	personalizing and risk stratifying screening recommendations for women 40-74 based on their family and cancer medical history as well as genetic testing for those in the personalized arm of the study. screening can be any where from every 6 months, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year, or stop screening till age 50.	5 years (expected additional funding possibly)	From consenting time point to the end of funding for the study (3 years +)	\N	The primary objective of this study is to determine whether personalized screening can prevent at least as many late-stage cancers as annual screening while requiring fewer biopsies. Therefore, this study has two co-primary endpoints, one to quantify safety and one to quantify morbidity.  Safety is measured by the rate of cancers diagnosed at stage IIB or higher. Morbidity is measured by the rate of breast biopsy. This trial will be considered a success if the risk based screening approach is found to be non-inferior to the annual screening approach in terms of safety and superior to the annual screening approach in terms of morbidity.  \nWomen who consent to be randomized will be randomized 1:1 to either annual screening or a risk based screening recommendation.  Randomization will be stratified by site and risk strata as determined by the BCSC model.	The study is currently in its third year (out of 5) of funding however most recruitment started in year 2. All sites are currently initiated with approximately 9,000 recruited. The recruitment goal for 2018 is 26,954 across all sites with the total goal being 80,000 by the end of funding year. Each site has a different approach to recruitment therefore estimating the length of time it takes to enroll the planned number of subjects is difficult. Recruitment efforts are highly important since annual funding is dependent on meeting recruitment goals.

We will collect real-world information from a geographically diverse, nationally representative sample of inpatient rehabilitation facilities in order to identify the aspects of care delivery that promote successful community discharge following inpatient rehabilitation (Aim 1). We will simultaneously partner with geographically diverse samples of individuals recently discharged from inpatient rehabilitation and their caregivers to identify the barriers and facilitators of successful community discharge (Aim 2). We will then test the feasibility of integrating facility and patient/caregiver information to develop an implementable program to improve rates of successful community discharge following inpatient rehabilitation (Aim 3). The deliverables will be new knowledge on factors that promote successful community discharge, the development of a program to improve this outcome, which we will test in a future implementation study, and an approach for developing implementable programs that can be applied to other patient-centered outcomes and settings.	We will use a qualitative methodology to achieve the study aims. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities will be identified through their rates of community discharges. We will purposively sample 16 geographically diverse high and low performing facilities (8 of each) and conduct key informant phone interviews with discharge planners (Aim1). We will also recruit 45 individuals within 1 to 6 months of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and their caregivers (90 participants total) to participate in one, 1.5 hour focus group (10 per group) on barriers and facilitators to successful community discharge (Aim 2). We will leverage CTSA recruitment and community engagement resources to recruit these patient/caregiver dyads. Finally, we will recruit a group of inpatient rehabilitation stakeholders for a one-day in-person meeting to develop an implementable program to improve rates of successful community discharge (Aim 3).	Aim 1. Identify the aspects of care delivery that promote successful community discharge following inpatient rehabilitation. We will conduct phone interviews with a geographically diverse sample of discharge planners in inpatient rehabilitation facilities to gather information on care transition and follow-up programs. This information will be integrated with facility rates of successful community discharge to identify practices reliably present in high-performing facilities and reliably absent in low-performing facilities.\n\nAim 2. Partner with individuals recently discharged from inpatient rehabilitation and their caregivers to identify the barriers and facilitators to successful community discharge. We will conduct focus groups and use thematic analysis to isolate factors that promote or hinder successful community discharge from the patient and caregiver perspectives.\n\nAim 3. Test the feasibility of integrating facility and patient/caregiver information to develop an implementable program to improve rates of successful community discharge following inpatient rehabilitation. Success will be defined as being able to triangulate the robust information collected in Aims 1 and 2 to develop a program for improving rates of successful community discharge that a panel of inpatient rehabilitation stakeholders considers beneficial, implementable, and sustainable.	The metric of success for Aim 1 is creation of a list of care transition and/or follow-up practices that may promote patients' successful discharge to the community.\n\nThe metric of success for Aim 2 is creation of a list of factors from the patient and caregiver perspective that promote (or hinder) successful discharge to the community.\n\nThe metric of success for Aim 3 is the creation of an implementable program that can be tested in a future multi-site implementation study.	1	Inclusion criteria: Adult (over 18 years of age) patients within 1 to 6 months of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and their caregivers.\n\nExclusion criteria: inability to give informed consent, inability to travel to focus group, dementia, moderate/severe cognitive impairment	The project will be a collaboration between investigators from three CTSA hubs- South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research Institute (Medical University of South Carolina, Middleton), Duke Clinical & Translational Science Institute (Duke University, Bettger), and Institute for Translational Sciences (University of Texas Medical Branch, Graham).

No financial or other conflicts of interest to report.	We will only use qualitative analyses. The description of these analyses is as follows: we will use the constant comparative method. This process involves reviewing transcripts as they are collected and refining the coding structure with each review. This iterative process will also allow us to identify when thematic saturation has been achieved. We will operationally define thematic saturation as the point when no new codes are developed, indicating further data collection is not needed. We will then review the complete set of transcripts with the finalized coding structure to identify themes. At least two members of the study team will independently review and code all transcripts. Any coding discrepancies will be discussed in team meetings until a consensus is reached. Once we have completed final coding on all transcripts, we will use qualitative software to analyze the coded data.	\N

A Phase III, randomized, open label study to compare the safety and efficacy of first-line combination    therapy (sildenafil and bosentan) to first-line monotherapy (sildenafil or bosentan) in pediatric subjects    with Panama Pediatric Functional Class II {2} and precapillary pulmonary hypertension. Precapillary    pulmonary hypertension will be defined as at cardiac catheterization as mean pulmonary artery pressure    over 25 mmHg as well as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (or left ventricular end diastolic pressure) ? 15 mmHg.        While clinical endpoints will be the focus of this study, we hypothesize that inherent genomic    variations will associate with clinical response by subjects. Biospecimens will be obtained for    ancillary studies to test the hypothesis that therapeutic responders will have an altered biomarker    profile compared to those who do not respond well dual oral therapy. Biospecimens will include    the following:    a. Blood for DNA, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, plasma, and serum;    b. PAXgene tubes for RNA and miRNA studies; and    c. Urine.        Because sildenafil and bosentan have different mechanisms of action targeting different    intracellular pathways, and have not demonstrated any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic    concerns when they are co-administered, we feel that combination therapy is a rational treatment    strategy for pediatric patients with PAH. Pharmacokinetics will also be assessed, and data from    mono- and dual therapy participants will be compared.	�The primary objective of this study is to compare the two treatment strategies - first-line combination    therapy (sildenafil and bosentan) versus first-line monotherapy (sildenafil or bosentan) - in    pediatric subjects with PAH. This will be assessed by time to the first clinical failure event.        �The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the change in other clinical measures of PAH    after initiating first-line combination therapy or first-line monotherapy, in subjects with PAH.    �The safety and tolerability of combination therapy will be compared to first-line monotherapy.

Primary Analysis    Time to clinical failure will be displayed as Kaplan-Meier event-free curves from    randomization up to the final visit. Differences between the curves will be tested for significance    by the stratified log-rank statistic, such that the stratifying variables are the etiologic diagnosis    for the pulmonary arterial hypertension and the Panama Functional Class.        The hazard ratio will be used to characterize the treatment effect and 95% confidence intervals    will be calculated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. In case data for some    subjects is not available following loss to follow up, their event times will be treated as censored    for statistical analyses. The first event that occurs will be counted for subjects experiencing    more than one component of the primary (composite) endpoint during the study. In such cases,    all events will be counted separately for the analysis of the individual components.    Any events occurring after the final study visit will be reported as a separate summary.        b. Secondary Analyses    Analyses of secondary endpoints will compare combination therapy to pooled data for all single    agent therapy with either bosentan or sildenafil alone.    �The percentage of subjects with satisfactory clinical response will analyzed as a binary    endpoint (yes = satisfied vs. no = not satisfied) using logistic regression, with the etiologic    diagnosis for the pulmonary arterial hypertension and the Panama Functional Class class as    covariates.    �Six minute walk distance (6MWD) test data will be analysed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test    stratified by the etiologic diagnosis for the pulmonary arterial hypertension and the Panama    Functional Class.    �Change from baseline in Panama Functional Class will be tested using a Wilcoxon rank sum    test, stratified by the etiologic diagnosis for the pulmonary arterial hypertension and the Panama    Functional Class at baseline.

Accordingly we propose a randomized clinical trial of using genetic risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), to initiate statin therapy in individuals at intermediate risk. The goal of the proposed trial is to investigate whether statin therapy in participants with increased genetic risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), reduces adverse cardiovascular events in patients at intermediate 10-y of ASCVD risk (5-7.5%). We hypothesized that in patients whose 10-y ASCVD risk after incorporating a GRS for ASCVD exceeds 7.5%, those randomized to statin therapy will have lower rate of adverse CV outcomes.	Protocol Summary. Eligibility criteria will include: men and women ≥50 years of age without a history of cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol level <190 mg/dL and an intermediate risk of ASCVD (5-7.5% 10-y risk), willingness to participate for the duration of the trial, and a triglyceride level <500 mg per deciliter. Exclusion criteria will include previous or current use of lipid-lowering therapy,  evidence of hepatic dysfunction (an alanine aminotransferase level >twice the upper limit of the normal range),  a creatinine level >2.0 mg per deciliter, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure >190 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >100 mm Hg), cancer within 5 years before enrollment (with the exception of basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin),  a recent history of alcohol or drug abuse or another medical condition that might compromise safety or the successful completion of the study. \nEligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rosuvastatin, 20 mg daily, or matching placebo. Randomization will be performed with the use of an interactive voice-response system and stratified according to center and family history of CHD. Follow-up visits will be scheduled to occur at 13 weeks and then 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 months after randomization. A closeout visit will occur after study termination. Follow-up assessments will include laboratory evaluations, pill counts, and structured interviews assessing outcomes and potential adverse events. Measurements of lipid levels, hepatic and renal function, blood glucose levels, and glycated hemoglobin values will be performed in a central laboratory. Personnel at each site will also contact their participants midway between scheduled visits to evaluate their well-being and to maintain study participation.	A major impediment to reducing the morbidity and mortality from CHD is the suboptimal performance of existing CHD risk calculators which do not incorporate family history or genetic factors. Up to 50% of CHD may be heritable with polygenic or oligogenic and/or monogenic factors contributing to disease predisposition. We have previously shown that incorporating a GRS leads to significant reclassification of CHD risk in individuals at 'intermediate' risk{Ding, 2011 #44759} and others have shown that a GRS for CHD is predictive of incident adverse events and response to statins.{Mega, 2015 #51} Genetic profiling is a promising means of improving the precision of risk estimates for individual patients. Studies by Mega et al.{Mega, 2015 #43819} and Khera et al.{Khera, 2016 #44853} demonstrate that individuals in the highest quintile of a polygenic risk score for CHD are at 77-90% higher risk for adverse events. \nAccordingly we propose a randomized clinical trial of using genetic risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of mortality in the Western world, to initiate statin therapy in individuals at intermediate risk. \n\nThe objective of the proposed trial is to investigate whether statin therapy in participants with increased genetic risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), reduces adverse cardiovascular events in patients at intermediate 10-y of ASCVD risk (5-7.5%). We hypothesize that in patients whose 10-y ASCVD risk after incorporating a GRS for ASCVD exceeds 7.5%, those randomized to statin therapy will have lower rate of adverse CV outcomes.	The primary outcome will be the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event, defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, an arterial revascularization procedure, or confirmed death from cardiovascular causes. Secondary end points will include the components of the primary end point considered individually - arterial revascularization or hospitalization for unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes - and death from any cause.\n\nAll reported primary end points will be adjudicated on the basis of standardized criteria by an independent end-point committee unaware of the randomized treatment assignments. Only deaths classified as clearly due to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular causes by the end-point committee will be included in the analysis of the primary end point. For the end point of death from any cause, all deaths will be included, regardless of whether data were available to confirm the cause of death. \n\nAll primary analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis. Event rates for the rosuvastatin and placebo groups will be compared using the proportional-hazards regression model to adjust for variable length of follow-up.\nFrequency of interim efficacy analyses and rules for early trial termination will be prespecified and approved by all members of this board.	1	Eligibility criteria will include: men and women ≥50 years of age without a history of cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol level <190 mg/dL and an intermediate risk of ASCVD (5-7.5% 10-y risk), willingness to participate for the duration of the trial, and a triglyceride level <500 mg per deciliter. Exclusion criteria will include previous or current use of lipid-lowering therapy, evidence of hepatic dysfunction (an alanine aminotransferase level >twice the upper limit of the normal range), a creatine kinase level >more than three times the upper limit of the normal range, a creatinine level >2.0 mg per deciliter, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure >190 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >100 mm Hg), cancer within 5 years before enrollment (with the exception of basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin), and a recent history of alcohol or drug abuse or another medical condition that might compromise safety or the successful completion of the study.	Given the large number of individuals to be recruited, we envision this to be a multinational, multicenter trial including sites outside of the US.	A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial will be conducted to assesses whether statin therapy based on a GRS for ASCVD is associated with a reduction in adverse events in patients at intermediate risk (5-7.5% over 10 years). Individuals (n=6628) without known ASCVD, with a 10-y risk of ASCVD of 5-7.5% and who are reclassified as having >7.5% risk based on their GRS, will be randomly allocated to a statin (rosuvastatin 20 mg) daily vs placebo. The 10-y ASCVD risk will be estimated based on pooled cohort equations (PCE) provided in the ACC/AHA guidelines. A GRS for ASCVD will be calculated from genotypes at ~100 susceptibility loci for CHD and ischemic stroke as previously described.	We propose a 5-year follow up after randomization.	66 months.	No conflicts.	Individuals at primary care visits, who are at intermediate risk (5-7.5% 10 year risk by PCE), will be genotyped to calculate the genetic risk score. The PCE will be multiplied by the GRS to estimate a composite risk based on their genetic and conventional risks. One would then identify a cohort that exceeds the current treatment threshold of 7.5% 10-y risk. If we assume that in the group screened, the average conventional 10-year risk is the average of 5% and 7.5%, i.e. 6.25%, and the risk is uniformly distributed between 5 and 7.5% and the distribution of GRS is similar to that in our MIGENES study, we can multiply the risk ratio factor in that dataset by the CRS risk to obtain the composite risk.  \n\nGiven these assumptions, we can obtain the distribution of composite risk, and in particular we can identify what proportion has a risk >7.5%. We estimated 23% of those with an average risk will have a composite risk >7.5% to 8.95% (9%). Thus, we will identify a cohort with composite risk >7.5% (23%) whose average risk is 9%. To determine sample size necessary to detect a 30% reduction from the baseline risk, we assume a 5 year trial, and assume that the risks are ½ of the 10-year risks. Therefore the 5-year risks (without statins) will be either ½ of 9% (4.5%). The number of patients required is a function of the baseline rate. For a baseline rate of 4.5%, and for a 30% reduction, the required number of patients is 6628. With a screening ratio of 23%, this translates to either 6628 / 0.23 = 28,817 screened.	We would recruit participants from primary care and cardiology clinics across the US and additional countries. We expect 6-12 months between initiation and active recruitment. Enrollment at sites would be over 1 year period. Recruitment efforts are key to meeting the goals.

This is based on experience as a clinical trialist and review of the literature.  There will be quite experienced investigators on the steering committee.  Recruitment will be critical.
28	2016-11-18	7	\N	\N	Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies of RUC-4, a Novel ?IIb?3 Pure Antagonist for First Point of Care Contact Treatment of ST Segment Elevated Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)	STEMI Study	2	Hypothesis: First point of contact therapy of ST Segment Elevated Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) with RUC-4, a novel aIIb?3 antagonist, will decrease mortality; increase the percentage of patients with TIMI 2-3 blood flow at the time of percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PCI);  and reduce infarct size and the complications of STEMI, including the development of heart failure.    Primary Objective: Design a Phase 2 study to: 1. assess whether the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of RUC-4 are different in patients with STEMI than in patients with stable coronary artery disease, and 2. Identify a dose of RUC-4 that is worthy of testing in a Phase 3 study based on its safety (bleeding being the major expected toxicity based on data from existing aIIb?3 antagonists) and efficacy.	5.1.3 Phase 2 Study Synopsis    Name of Investigational Product:    RUC-4    Name of Active Ingredient:    2-amino-N-(5-(5-oxo-7-(piperazin-1-yl)-5H-[1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-2-    yl)pyridin-3-yl)acetamide    Title of Study:    Open Label, Placebo Controlled, 4 Arm, Single Dose Study to Assess the Efficacy,    Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of RUC-4 Succinate    Administered SC via a Prefilled Syringe to Patients with STEMI in Conjunction with    Aspirin.    Objectives:    To assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of    RUC-4 plus aspirin in STEMI patients in the pre-hospital setting at 3 different RUC-4    fixed doses.    CONFIDENTIAL 84    Vol 1. 000087    Dosing:    All patients will receive aspirin as per EMS protocol. 4 arms. Arm 1: Aspirin + Single    dose saline placebo SC; Arm 2: Aspirin + Single dose RUC-4 SC based on the effective    biologic dose for a person weighing 110 kg. Arm 3. Aspirin + Single dose RUC-4 SC    based on the effective biologic dose for a person weighing 100 kg. Arm 4. Aspirin +    Single dose RUC-4 SC based on the effective biologic dose for a person weighing 90    kg. Dosing rationale: The maximum dose that will be assessed in the Phase 1 study is a    fixed dose calculated based on the effective dose for a person weighing 110 kg. As a    result, this is the highest dose that will be tested in the Phase 2 study. The two lower    doses will be tested to assess whether they are less effective or safer than the highest    dose, as might be expected.    Endpoints:    Primary: Pre-percutaneous coronary artery intervention (pre-PCI; pre-procedural)    TI    Rationale: We have selected pre-procedural TIMI 3 blood flow and TIMI perfusion    grade 3 in the target vessel as the primary endpoint since this combination has been    shown to correlate well with medical outcomes in STEMI treated with thrombolytic    therapy and since in terms of biologic plausibility it is most closely associated with the    expected benefits of early treatment with a powerful antiplatelet agent. This is    demonstrated in the meta-analysis of abciximab by Xu et al., where 'early' treatment    with abciximab was associated with a 17.7% rate of pre-procedural TIMI 3 flow    compared to 11.0% in the group receiving late abciximab (RR 2.58, 95%, CI 1.46, 3.14;    p=0.0001). Pre-procedural blood flow measured by the corrected TIMI frame count,    which provides a more precise measure of blood flow, has been variably shown to    correlate with a wide range of beneficial outcomes in STEMI patients undergoing PCI,    with the correlation being most impressive in high risk patients (anterior MI, TIMI risk    score ?3 or 4). These include improved early and late mortality, early ST-segment    resolution, better preserved ejection fraction, reduced clinical congestive heart failure,    improved myocardial blush grade, and less new onset sustained hypotension and need    for intubation. TIMI blood flow grade, corrected TIMI frame counts, and TIMI perfusion    blush grade will be performed in a core laboratory by expert analysts based on the preprocedure    angiograms.    MI 3 blood flow and TIMI perfusion grade 3 in the target vessel.    Secondary:    1. Pre-procedural TIMI 2+3 flow (since some studies have combined these for better    discrimination).,    2. TIMI frame count.    3. Pre-procedural thrombus burden.    4. Intra-procedural complications (including no reflow and distal embolization),    5. Post-procedural TIMI 3 blood flow.    6. ST segment resolution within 60 ? 30 minutes of PCI, categorized as complete    (?70%), partial (<70 to 50%), or none (<50%).    7. Infarct size measured by the area under the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) enzyme    curve from samples drawn immediately following the PCI procedure and then at 6,    12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours following PCI.    8. All-cause mortality at 90 days.    9. Complications of STEMI (ventricular fibrillation, intubation, cardiogenic shock).    10. Left ventricle ejection fraction during hospitalization.    11. Admission for congestive heart failure within 90 days.    12. Patient Reported Outcomes based on time to relief of chest pain, the the Seattle    Angina Questionnaire, the Duke Activity Status Index, and the Minnesota Living    with Heart Failure Questionnaire.    Rationale:    Some studies have combined TIMI 2 and TIMI 3 flow for comparison to TIMI 0 and    TIMI 1 flow. Resolution of ST segment elevation is also a strong correlate of clinical    outcome and was also improved by abciximab in the meta-analysis by Xu et al. (43.0 vs    35.5%; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12, 1.53; p=0.0007). We make this a secondary endpoint    because it depends both on the RUC-4 effect and the skill of the PCI team. The    endpoints in FINESSE trial, which include all-cause mortality, ventricular fibrillation,    cardiogenic shock, and 90-day risk of readmission for CHF will be additional secondary    end points.    Eligibility:    Patients of any age, either sex, weight between 55 and 110 kg, chest pain of 30 minutes    or more duration, ST segment elevation in precordial leads indicating anterior location    by the criteria used in the IMMEDIATE trial, TIMI risk score >3 time from onset of    symptoms <4 hours, planned primary PCI to begin in 1 hour or more.    Exclusion criteria:    As per the FINESSE trial	See Objective/Hypothesis.	See Study Design	1	See Study Design	Not provided	STEMI is a life-threatening disorder that is associated with significant mortality, and both short term and long term morbidity, most notably congestive heart failure. There are compelling data that early treatment (that is, within the first 2 hours after symptom onset) with fibrinolytic agents, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or ?IIb?3 antagonists can result in reperfusion and improved outcomes, including reduce mortality. Despite this information, many patients do not receive treatment within the first two hours for a variety of reasons, including delays in transport to a PCI center and delays even after reaching a PCI center.     To address the need for early therapy, we have developed a novel pure antagonist of aIIb?3, RUC-4, specially designed to facilitate rapid treatment of STEMI at the first point of medical contact, whether that is an Emergency Medical Service (EMS) ambulance, the emergency room (ER) of a 'spoke' hospital, or the ER of PCI-capable hospital. Data support the benefit of treating with one of the current aIIb?3 antagonists, abciximab, at each of these sites compared to cath laboratory treatment. RUC-4 is unique among small molecule aIIb?3 antagonists in not inducing the receptor to undergo the major conformational change that may contribute to the development of thrombocytopenia and may also limit efficacy by inducing the high affinity ligand binding state. It is also unique in its design for subcutaneous (SC) administration and its high solubility, making it possible to be conveniently administered by autoinjector. This contrasts with the need for intravenous administration as a bolus and continuous infusion via a pump for the other agents.     We conducted the RUC-4 Pre-IND meeting with the FDA on July 18, 2016 and the FDA approved with minor amendments to the Phase 1 studies (attached), which are designed to assess the tolerability of RUC-4 in patients with stable coronary disease who are taking aspirin and to identify a fixed dose of RUC-4 that can achieve the biologic endpoint goal of inhibiting platelet aggregation induced by 5 mM ADP by ?80% within 15 minutes of administration.     The goals of the two Phase 2 studies, as currently conceived are to: 1. assess whether the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of RUC-4 are different in patients with STEMI than in patients with stable coronary artery disease, and 2. Identify a dose of RUC-4 that is worthy of testing in a Phase 3 study based on its safety (bleeding being the major expected toxicity based on data from existing aIIb?3 antagonists) and efficacy. Currently, we propose to assess the latter by measuring the known clinical complications of STEMI as well as the surrogate indicators of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) blood flow and myocardial perfusion in the target vessel prior to PCI, ST segment resolution, and infarct size. While the original plan was to perform this study exclusively with EMS personnel in ambulances, based on the data showing similar benefits from administering aIIb?3 antagonist in in ERs of both 'spoke' and PCI-capable hospitals (see attached slide deck) we now plan to expand the study to all of these first medical contact sites. The draft design of the Phase 2 study is attached, along with a brief description of the proposed Phase 3 study. I will also be pleased to supply the Pre-IND FDA Meeting Document and the FDA Minutes of that meeting.    For the Phase 2 study we request assistance with the power calculations to judge the number of individuals we will need to study in both phases of the study. We would also appreciate assistance in the design of the informed consent process, developing the detailed methodology for assessing each endpoint, and the statistical analysis plan. We would also benefit greatly from an assessment of recruitment feasibility. Finally, we would like assistance in these same areas for the design of the Phase 3 study.     We would of course be delighted to propose the Phase 2 (and later Phase 3) study to the CTSA trial network. The new SIREN consortium may help complement the CTSA trial network. I plan to contact the successful coordinating center as soon as the award is made.

224	2017-11-09	5	\N	\N	Treatments Against RA and Effect on FDG PEAT CT; The TARGET Trial	TARGET Trial	5	Précis: The overarching goal of this trial is to examine the effect of RA disease\nmodifying drugs (DMARDs) on vascular inflammation. We will accomplish\nthis goal by comparing two treatment regimens for RA in the setting of an\nRCT in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX)\nmonotherapy. These are: a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) + MTX\nversus triple therapy (MTX + sulfasalazine [SSZ] + hydroxychloroquine\n[HCQ]). The trial design is a two-arm RCT with blinded joint assessment and\nblinded FDG PET/CT readers. Subjects and rheumatologists will be\nunblinded to treatment assignment but will be blinded to FDG PET/CT\nresults. Joint count assessors will be blinded to treatment assignment. The\ntrial will be conducted at multiple sites across the US, with a duration of six\nmonths. Recruitment will be over 24 months with six more months of\nfollow-up.\nObjectives: Primary: To compare the effects on vascular inflammation of TNFi + MTX\nversus triple therapy in subjects with RA who are inadequate responders\nto MTX monotherapy using FDG PET/CT as a tool for detecting vascular\n(arterial) inflammation.\nSecondary: To compare the effects on vascular inflammation of achieving\nlow disease activity or remission (LDAR) vs moderate-high disease activity\n(MHDA).\nPopulation: Subjects for this trial will be RA patients who are deemed methotrexateinadequate\nresponders (MTX-IRs, DAS28>3.2) by their treating\nrheumatologist, and who have not yet started treatment with a biologic\nDMARD and are currently not receiving any other DMARD than MTX. In\norder to enrich our trial subjects for atherosclerosis, male RA patients must\nbe at least 45 years old, and women at least 50 years old. Additional\ninclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Section 3 of this document.\nPhase: Phase IV\nNumber of Sites: This will be a multicenter study. The lead sites will be Brigham & Women's\nHospital and Columbia University Medical Center.\nParticipating sites will be selected based on the following criterion:\nadequate number of RA patients; access to an FDG-PET scanner; availability \n9\nof trial staff (i.e. coordinator, nurse, trained joint count assessor\n(metrologist); and experience enrolling and following subjects in previous\nclinical trials.\nDescription of\nIntervention:\nEnrolled subjects will be asked to take 6 months of RA medication according\nto the treatment arm to which they are randomized, which will be either be\ntriple therapy or a TNFi.\nSubjects will be evaluated every six weeks for clinical response. For subjects\nreceiving a TNFi, if good treatment response (CDAI ≤10) is not achieved by\n18 weeks, then treatment will be adjusted. For subjects receiving\nadalimumab, this medication will be discontinued and switched to\netanercept 50 mg every week. If the subject is receiving etanercept, this\nmedication will be discontinued and switched to adalimumab 40 mg every\nother week. Subjects will remain on this new medication until the end of the\nstudy at 24 weeks.\nSubjects assigned to the triple therapy arm will begin SSZ 500 mg twice daily\nand HCQ 200 mg twice daily, not to exceed 6.5 mg/kg. At 6 weeks, the dose\nof SSZ will increase from 500 mg twice daily to 1 g twice daily for all\npatients. At 18 weeks, if a good treatment response (CDAI ≤ 10) has not\nbeen achieved, MTX will be stopped and leflunomide 20 mg daily started.\nThe participant will remain on leflunomide (and concomitant SSZ + HCQ) for\nthe remaining six weeks of the study.\nStudy Duration: 48 months\nSubject Participation\nDuration:\n6 months\nEstimated Time to\nComplete Enrollment:\n24 months	3. STUDY DESIGN\n3.1 Overview\nThis is a multi-center, phase IV, 24-week, two arm randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects of\nDMARD associated changes in vascular inflammation in patients with RA. The overall study design is\nshown in Figure 1. Two hundred patients with RA who are inadequate responders to MTX monotherapy\n(MTX-IRs, DAS28>3.2) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a TNFi or SSZ + HCQ, while\ncontinuing background MTX, for 24 weeks. Although the joint count assessors and imaging readers will\nbe blinded to treatment assessment, the subjects and investigators will not be blinded.\n\nRandomization and Blinding\nUpon confirmation of subject eligibility, the Site Coordinator will determine treatment assignment\nthrough a randomization function of the electronic data capture (EDC). Randomization will be\nperformed centrally by the DCC using a permuted block design. Metrologists performing joint\ncounts will be blinded to treatment assignment, as will the FDG-PET/CT imaging readers. Laboratory\nstaff who run bioassays on biospecimen samples will also be blinded to treatment assignment.\nSubjects will be instructed NOT to discuss their treatment with the metrologist, and the metrologist\nwill not be a part of the subject's care team. The metrologist will also be instructed to remind the\nsubject before each joint examination that treatment should not be discussed. In addition, the\nmetrologist should not discuss treatment with the site PI or other study staff.	7. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN\n7.1 Primary and Secondary Objectives\nThe primary objective is to compare the effects on vascular inflammation of TNFi + MTX versus triple\ntherapy in subjects with RA who are inadequate responders to MTX monotherapy using FDG-PET/CT as a\ntool for detecting vascular (arterial) inflammation.\nThe secondary objective is to compare the effects on vascular inflammation of achieving low disease\nactivity or remission (LDAR) versus moderate-high disease activity (MHDA).\n7.2 Study Hypothesis\nThe primary aim of the Treatments Against RA and Effect on FDG PET/CT (TARGET) trial is to test\nwhether treatment with a TNF inhibitor (TNFi) in addition to methotrexate (MTX) among RA subjects\nwho are inadequate responders to MTX monotherapy reduces cardiovascular inflammation compared\nto triple therapy (MTX+SSZ+HCQ) as measured by the mean of the maximum target-to-background ratio\n(TBR) of FDG uptake at the 6 month follow-up for the most diseased segment (MDS) identified at\nbaseline. .\nThe primary hypothesis is that TNFi +MTX will reduce vascular inflammation to a greater extent than\ntriple therapy when measured at 6 months.\nAdditional planned analyses in the second aim test whether the follow-up value in cardiovascular\ninflammation is correlated with measures of disease progression. The markers of disease progression\ninclude: 1) disease activity as measured by the DAS28-CRP score, with achievement of low disease\nactivity or remission considered to be a DAS28-CRP score of less than 3.2 at the 6-month follow-up (all\nparticipants enter the trial with a DAS28 above 3.2); 2) a commercially available MBDA (Vectra-DA)\nwhich will be measured at baseline and 6 months; and 3) joint inflammation defined as the average\nstandardized uptake value (by FDG PET/CT) in the same joints used in the calculation of the DAS-28, and\nmeasured at baseline and 6 months using the images collected for the primary endpoint as described in\nthe Imaging Section.\nThe secondary hypotheses are as follows:\n We hypothesize that subjects in DAS-28 defined LDAR at 6 months will have less vascular\ninflammation than those with persistent MHDA.\n We hypothesize that subjects in Vectra DA-defined LDAR at 6 months will have less vascular\ninflammation than those with persistent MHDA. \n43\n We hypothesize that subjects in articular FDG defined LDAR at 6 months will have less\nvascular inflammation than those with persistent MHDA. We will also compare the correlations\nof the articular FDG uptake and DAS-28 with vascular inflammation to determine if they are\nindependent	7.5 Analysis Sets\nThe primary analysis for efficacy will be defined as all randomized subjects with complete imaging\nresults at baseline and 6 months, according to their randomized treatment assignment. Safety analyses\nwill be done using all subjects entering the study, according to the treatment received. Per-protocol\nanalyses will also be done for participants who remained on their randomized treatment assignment for\nthe duration of follow-up.\n7.6 Safety Analysis\nAll participating subjects will be included in safety analyses, regardless of their completion of the\nimaging studies. The two arms of the trial both use standard of care treatments, so serious\nunanticipated adverse events are unlikely. Reports of adverse events by randomized treatment\nassignment and actual treatment will be generated for the DSMB at regular intervals of approximately 6\nmonths.

The study\nsites play an essential role in answering the questions posed by this study. Each site will be responsible\nfor enrolling participants, carrying out the study protocol, recording and transmitting study information,\nsatisfying regulatory requirements, and providing clinical oversight. The DCC and Administrative Core\nwill support Sites in these efforts, from training through implementation. As well, the Imaging Core will\nsupport the FDG PET/CT acquisition.\nSite Requirements for Eligibility include:\n• Prior experience with clinical trials\n• At least 150 active RA patients\n• Easy access to FDG-PET CT imaging acquisition facility\n• Easy access to standard clinical laboratory assessments\n• Joint count assessor\nT	A brief description of each of the study medications (all of which, as noted above, are FDA approved) is\nprovided below. More detailed descriptions of each drug are provided in the following links to the FDA\napproved package inserts:\n1) Adalimumab: http://www.rxabbvie.com/pdf/humira.pdf\n2) Etanercept: http://pi.amgen.com/united_states/enbrel/derm/enbrel_pi.pdf\n3) Sulfasalazine: http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=524\n4) Hydroxychloroquine:\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/009768s041lbl.pdf\n5) Leflunomide: http://products.sanofi.us/arava/arava.html\n6) Methotrexate Injection:\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/011719s117lbl.pdf\n7) Methotrexate tablets: http://www.rheumatrex.info/pdf/RheumatrexPackageInsert.pdf\nEtanercept. The standard dose of etanercept is 50 mg SC once weekly. The drug is provided\nalready diluted to the appropriate concentration in pre-filled syringes. It is typically injected into the\nabdomen or thigh. The medication must be refrigerated.\nAdalimumab. The standard initial dose of adalimumab is 40 mg SC once every other week. Like\netanercept, it is provided already diluted to the appropriate concentration in pre-filled syringes. It is\nalso injected into the abdomen or thigh and must be refrigerated.\n30\nSulfasalazine. SSZ is formulated as tablets for oral use. Maximum dosing is usually 1500 mg bid.\nPatients with Sulfa allergies or G6PD deficiency should not be prescribed this medication and are\nexcluded from the study.\nHydroxychloroquine. The approved dose of HCQ is either 200 mg once daily or twice daily. HCQ\ndose shall not exceed 6.5 mg/kg to conform to current guidelines for retinal safety. The most recent\nrecommendations from the American Academy of Ophthalmology advise a baseline screening\nexamination within the first twelve months of treatment115\n.\nLeflunomide. Leflunomide is approved at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg once daily. We will use 20 mg\ndaily as it is the most common effective dose.\n\nSubjects randomized to the TNFi treatment arm will (based on randomization) receive either etanercept\n50 mg SC weekly or adalimumab 40 mg SQ every other week (in addition to concomitant MTX). Subjects\nwill continue the same dose of their concomitant background MTX. If the subject's CDAI score is greater\nthan 10 at 18 weeks, a good treatment response has not been achieved116, then treatment will be\nswitched to the other TNFi of interest for this trial. Subjects who initially started etanercept will be\nswitched to adalimumab 40 mg SQ every other week. Subjects who initially started adalimumab will be\nswitched to entanercept 50 mg SQ weekly. Subjects will remain on this new medication until the end of\nthe study at 24 weeks.\nSubjects assigned to the triple therapy arm will begin SSZ 500 mg bid and HCQ 200 mg twice daily, not to\nexceed 6.5mg/kg HCQ (in addition to concomitant MTX). At 6 weeks, SSZ will be increased to 1 g bid for\nall subjects. If the subject's CDAI score is greater than 10 at 18 weeks, a good treatment response116 has\nnot been achieved, and MTX will be switched to leflunomide 20 mg daily. The participant will remain on\nleflunomide (and concomitant SSZ + HCQ) for the remaining six weeks of the study.\n4.4 Concomitant Medications\n4.4.1 Corticosteriods\nPatients who are not receiving corticosteroids and those receiving low dose steroids (≤ 10 mg/day of\nprednisone or equivalent) will be considered eligible for the study provided other entry criteria are\nmet. Excessive dosages of steroids may suppress vascular FDG uptake independently of the\nrandomized treatment. Prednisone (or equivalent) doses should not be altered by more than ±3.0\nmg during the six months of the study. Two intra-articular injections of <40 mg triamcinolone (or\nequivalent) will be allowed during the study, but cannot be within one month of the second FDG\nPET/CT at the 24 week visit. No oral corticosteroid "bursts" will be allowed unless there is reason\nthat an intra-articular injection is impossible. If a burst is required, it can be no more than 10mg per\nday (prednisone equivalent) at maximum and no longer than 14 days in duration before returning to \n+/- 3 mg of the original dose (or no use). Corticosteroid bursts cannot occur within one month of\neither of the FDG PET/CT scans.\n4.4.2 Statins & PCSK9 Inhibitors\nStatins and PCSK9 inhibitors have been shown to reduce arterial FDG uptake52. Therefore, patients\nwho have ever been treated with statins or PCSK9 inhibitors in the past 12 months or are currently\non a statin or a PCSK9 inhibitor are not eligible for the study. Patients likely to need a statin or\nPCSK9 inhibitor (e.g., diabetics and those with prior clinical CV events) are excluded from\nparticipation. Initiation of statins or PCSK9 inhibitors should be avoided if at all possible during the\nsix month study period. If this is not deemed safe by the study site investigator and one of the two\ncardiologists working on the trial (Drs.Tawakol and Ridker), then the subject will be asked to come in\nfor a follow-up FDG PET/CT before a statin or PCSK9 inhibitor is initiated. Subjects must have been\non study treatment for at least 8 weeks in order for the FDG PET/CT to take place. If the subject has\nbeen on study treatment for less than 8 weeks, the subject will be dropped from the trial without\ncompletion of the follow-up PET scan. If a subject initiates a statin or PCSK9 inhibitor before a\nfollow-up FDG PET/CT takes place, the subject will be dropped from the trial without follow-up\nimaging. This information will be included in the primary trial analysis	60 months	Subjects randomized to the TNFi treatment arm will (based on randomization) receive either etanercept\n50 mg SC weekly or adalimumab 40 mg SQ every other week (in addition to concomitant MTX). Subjects\nwill continue the same dose of their concomitant background MTX. If the subject's CDAI score is greater\nthan 10 at 18 weeks, a good treatment response has not been achieved116, then treatment will be\nswitched to the other TNFi of interest for this trial. Subjects who initially started etanercept will be\nswitched to adalimumab 40 mg SQ every other week. Subjects who initially started adalimumab will be\nswitched to entanercept 50 mg SQ weekly. Subjects will remain on this new medication until the end of\nthe study at 24 weeks.\nSubjects assigned to the triple therapy arm will begin SSZ 500 mg bid and HCQ 200 mg twice daily, not to\nexceed 6.5mg/kg HCQ (in addition to concomitant MTX). At 6 weeks, SSZ will be increased to 1 g bid for\nall subjects. If the subject's CDAI score is greater than 10 at 18 weeks, a good treatment response116 has\nnot been achieved, and MTX will be switched to leflunomide 20 mg daily. The participant will remain on\nleflunomide (and concomitant SSZ + HCQ) for the remaining six weeks of the study.	\N	We plan to randomize 200 participants to achieve an effective sample size of 170 people with complete\nfollow-up and measurements of both the baseline and 6-month MDS TBRmax. We estimate over 90%\npower to detect a difference of 0.15 in 6-month MDS meanmax TBR between the two arms, even\nallowing for a 10% dropout rate. A between group difference of 0.15 also corresponds to the expected\nobserved effect if the between group difference were 0.17 and there was a 10% crossover rate.\nSample size and power were calculated using several alternative scenarios for dropout rates and cross\nover. All cross over was assumed to be from the triple therapy arm into the TNFi arm and these\nparticipants would be included in the main intention-to-treat analysis set under their assigned\ntreatment group. Drop outs consist of participants for whom imaging results were unavailable at the\nbaseline or 6-month timepoint. These participants would be unable to contribute to the analysis and\nwould directly reduce the sample size available. Previous data in the RA population found a baseline\nMDS meanmax TBR of 2.51 (SD of 0.33) and a 0.46 reduction after 8 weeks of a TNFi (correlation of 0.5\nbetween baseline and 8 weeks).\nThe method that we intend to use for our primary analysis is an ANCOVA model estimating the final\nindex vessel MDS meanmax TBR as a function of baseline index vessel MDS meanmax TBR and\ntreatment group. The resulting treatment group coefficient will then estimate the change in MDS\nmeanmax TBR associated with treatment assignment after adjusting for baseline differences.\nPower for the ANCOVA analysis was calculated using the sampsi function in Stata. This function uses the\nmethod laid out by Frison and Pocock in Statistics in Medicine in 1992. We performed the power\ncalculations using a correlation between the baseline and final MDS TBR meanmax of conservative\ncorrelation estimates of 0.4 and 0.3 and have included the results in the Tables 4A and 4B below.\nTABLE 4a: Power Calculation for Aim 1 for Correlation of 0.4 (ANCOVA adjusting for\nbaseline)\n44\nDropout Rate\nBetween group difference 0% (N=200) 5% (N=190) 10% (N=180)\n0.17 98% 97% 96%\n0.16 (5% crossover into TNFi) 96% 95% 94%\n0.15 (10% crossover into TNFi) 94% 93% 91%\nTABLE 4b: Power Calculation for Aim 1 for Correlation of 0.3 (ANCOVA adjusting for\nbaseline)\nDropout Rate\nBetween group difference 0% (N=200) 5% (N=190) 10% (N=180)\n0.17 97% 96% 95%\n0.16 (5% crossover into TNFi) 95% 94% 93%\n0.15 (10% crossover into TNFi) 92% 91% 89%\nPower for the secondary aims\nThe secondary aim compares 6-month MDS meanmax TBR by LDAR achievement. The primary analysis\nwill use ANCOVA to adjust for baseline MDS meanmax TBR as well as other baseline characteristics\nrelated to LDAR achievement (age, gender, disease duration, smoking status, serologic status) and\ntreatment assignment. Assuming 30% reaching LDAR in both groups111-113, and the parameters of MDS\nmeanmax TBR from Aim 1, we use a t-test of 6-month MDS meanmax TBR as a conservative power\nestimate. The proposed trial will have 90% power to detect an absolute difference between those\nreaching LDAR and those not of 0.18 in MDS meanmax TBR with a dropout rate of up to 10%; this would\nbe clinically significant based on the aforementioned statin study52\n.\nTABLE 5: POWER CALCULATION FOR AIM 2\nDropout Rate\nBetween group difference 0% (N=200) 5% (N=190) 10% (N=180)\n0.18 94% 93% 92%\n0.17 91% 90% 88%\n45\n0.16 88% 86% 84%\n7.5 Analysis Sets\nThe primary analysis for efficacy will be defined as all randomized subjects with complete imaging\nresults at baseline and 6 months, according to their randomized treatment assignment. Safety analyses\nwill be done using all subjects entering the study, according to the treatment received. Per-protocol\nanalyses will also be done for participants who remained on their randomized treatment assignment for\nthe duration of follow-up.\n7.6 Safety Analysis\nAll participating subjects will be included in safety analyses, regardless of their completion of the\nimaging studies. The two arms of the trial both use standard of care treatments, so serious\nunanticipated adverse events are unlikely. Reports of adverse events by randomized treatment\nassignment and actual treatment will be generated for the DSMB at regular intervals of approximately 6\nmonths. We will also present frequency analyses for withdrawals and compliance with protocol.\n7.7 Analysis Methods\nAim 1:\nThe main analysis for Aim 1 will use ANCOVA to compare the 6-month arterial MDS meanmax TBR\nbetween assigned treatment groups, adjusting for baseline values and statin initiation, with a null\nhypothesis of no association between treatment assignment and 6-month MDS meanmax TBR. A pvalue\nthreshold of 0.05 for a two-sided test will be used to determine statistical significance. Additional\nanalyses will explore secondary imaging measures including meanmax overall TBR. We will also repeat\nthe main analysis in the subgroup per-protocol compliance. Other important subgroups will also be\nanalyzed within assigned treatment groups using an interaction term, including achievement of LDAR,\nserologic status, known CV risk factors, and excluding statin initiators.\nThe primary analysis will be based on assigned treatment group, only including participants with imaging\ndata at baseline and 6-month follow-up. A sensitivity analysis for the impact of any missing data will also\nbe done using the same assigned treatment categories, but using all randomized participants with\n[multiple imputations using a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique119. We anticipate few missing data\nbecause: 1) adequate staff (2 Research Assistants) in the Administrative Core will closely monitor weekly\ndata entry; 2) 24-week trial allows for detection of significant differences in vascular FDG PET/CT but will\nreduce drop-out that may occur in a longer trial; 3) recruitment of experienced sites with site\ncoordinators; 4) providing transportation reimbursement to subjects whenever necessary; and 5)\nproviding reminder mailing cards to sites to send to subjects. 2 secondary analyses were added based\non reviewers' comments: excluding subjects who escalated dosing; and, in an exploratory secondary\nanalysis, we will compare the 6-month MDS meanmax TBR between adalimumab and etanercept users.\n46\nSample Size: Power to detect alternate absolute differences in\n6 month MDS meanmax TBR is presented in Figure 2 for a\nstudy with 100 participants in each arm (200 total randomized\ntarget). Previous data in RA pts found a baseline MDS\nmeanmaxTBR of 2.51 (SD of 0.33) and a 0.46 reduction after 8\nweeks of a TNFi62. Using a t-test to compare MDS meanmax\nTBR in the two arms at 6-months generates a conservative\npower estimate. With an effective sample size of 170 (200-30;\n15% drop-out or cross-over), the proposed trial has a 90%\npower to detect an absolute difference of 0.17 between the 2\narms. This difference corresponds to the effect observed in\nthe prior study by Maki-Petaja for TNFi's62. It would be a\nclinically important difference, on the same order for what was observed between a low-dose statin and\na high-dose statin52, a contrast with known clinical significance53\n. [Power will be sufficient for secondary\nendpoints. The pre-specified secondary analysis focusing on approximately 75% of subjects remain on\nthe original drug dosages will include an estimated 64 subjects per arm and will have 90% power to\ndetect a difference of 0.19 in MDS meanmax TBR. Since these are pre-specified secondary endpoints, pvalues\nwill not be adjusted.]\nAim 2a:\nThis aim compares 6-month MDS meanmax TBR by LDAR achievement. The primary analysis will use\nANCOVA to adjust for baseline MDS meanmax TBR as well as other baseline characteristics related to\nLDAR achievement (age, gender, disease duration, smoking status, serologic status) and treatment\nassignment. Using a conservative estimate of 30% reaching LDAR in both groups111-113, and an effective\nsample size of 170, we ran a t-test of 6-month MDS meanmax TBR as a conservative power estimate.\nThe proposed trial will have 90% power to detect an absolute difference between those reaching LDAR\nand those not of 0.19 in MDS meanmax TBR; this difference would be clinically significant based on the\naforementioned statin study52\n.\nAims 2b and 2c: These exploratory aims will examine the relationship between the Vectra-DA and\narticular FDG uptake (respectively), and 6-month change in arterial MDS meanmax TBR. The analytic\nstrategies will be very similar to Aim 2a. Relationships between Vectra-DA disease activity categories\nand articular FDG PET/CT disease activity and 6-month change in MDS meanmax TBR will be analyzed\nsimilar to Aim 2a. The statistical power for Aims 2b and 2c will be very similar to Aim 2a. Exploratory\nanalyses will examine: 1) alternative thresholds for disease activity using the Vectra-DA and articular\nFDG PET/CT; 2) using the Vectra-DA and articular FDG PET/CT as continuous measures; and 3) including\nthe Vectra-DA and articular FDG PET/CT continuous measures as covariates in the ANCOVA conducted\nfor Aim 2a.	This will be a multicenter study with approximately 40 study sites. 400 RA patients will be recruited over\na planned recruitment period of 24 month, 200 will be randomized. The target population consists of\npatients who are deemed methotrexate-inadequate responders (MTX-IRs, DAS28>3.2) by their treating\nrheumatologist, and who have not yet stepped up to additional treatment with a biologic DMARD.\nPatients will be identified for potential recruitment by methods that may include using physician\nreferral, pre-screening enrollment logs, IRB or Sponsor approved sources, such as newspaper/radio\nadvertisements and/or mailing lists. Informed consent will be obtained by the Principal Investigator, co-\n25\ninvestigator, or Study Coordinator at each site. Study procedures including screening procedures will not\nbegin until signed informed consent has been obtained.\n.\n3.5 Recruitment and Retention\n3.5.1 Recruitment Plan\nThe target population to be recruited is men aged 45 and older or women aged 50 and older with a\nclinical diagnosis of RA who are deemed methotrexate-inadequate responders (MTX-IR) by their\ntreating rheumatologist. Patients will be recruited from participating rheumatology and arthritis\nclinics and practices at participating sites across the United States. A recommended method for\nidentifying and recruiting patients is described in the following sections and in more detail in the\nMOOP. Sites will generate and maintain a list of patients that may become eligible for the study\nbased on a HIPAA-compliant review of medical records of existing RA patients. The treating\nrheumatologists will alert study staff when a patient is deemed a MTX-IR, prior to a switch or\nescalation of DMARDs. The Site Coordinator will speak with the patient to go over pre-screening\ninclusion/exclusion criteria, explain the trial, and assess interest (Recruitment training will be\nprovided). The Study Brochure can be given to interested patients.\nIf the patient is interested in participating, a Site PI, Co-I, or Site Coordinator must obtain informed\nconsent prior to any screening procedures. The research protocol will be explained in detail,\nincluding all possible risks and benefits. During the consent process, the study coordinator or\ninvestigator probes the patient's understanding of the protocol. All participants will be told that the\nstudy is voluntary, that they have no obligation to participate, and that they may decline or\nwithdraw at any time without compromising their care. Subjects will have ample opportunity to ask\nquestions prior to signing the consent form. Eligible subjects will be allowed as much time as\nnecessary to determine whether they wish to participate in the study.\nPatients will be identified for potential recruitment by methods that may include using physician\nreferral, pre-screening enrollment logs, IRB or Sponsor approved sources, such as newspaper/radio\nadvertisements and/or mailing lists. Consent will be obtained at the beginning of the Screening Visit (Visit 1). Patients who meet eligibility criteria and provide informed consent will be considered enrolled and will undergo the\nadditional screening procedures outlined above in Table 1, including completion of questionnaires, screening laboratory tests including hepatitis B and C screens and tuberculosis screening (if none in the past six months),hemoglobin A1c test only for Type II diabetics if none from the past six months, and chest x-ray without evidence of interstitial lung disease (if none in past 12 months). Subjects found at Screening to have active hepatitis or active infection (including tuberculosis) or interstitial\nlung disease will be excluded. If the additional required screening blood work was completed by the\nsubject within 1 week of the screening visit (see 3.4 above), these tests do not need to be repeated.\nIf the subject has been on stable methotrexate or prednisone for the 8 weeks preceding the\nscreening visit, then safety labs performed during those 8 weeks do not need to be repeated at the\nscreening visit. CRP testing must be complete at the date of Screening when a joint count is done\nto determine the subject's eligibility for study inclusion. If these additional laboratory- and imagingbased\neligibility criteria are met and eligibility is confirmed, the FDG PET/CT scan will be scheduled.\nFor the FDG PET/CT, the subject will be given instructions for an overnight fast for the purposes of\nthe PET/CT scan. If nothing is found on the FDG PET/CT that would preclude the subject from\nrandomization, the subject will be randomized and a baseline visit will be conducted. The subject\nwill complete additional questionnaires at baseline. All subsequent study visits are performed at six\nweek intervals and should be conducted within 14 days prior to or after the designated date\n(calculated from the subject's randomization date). Blood will be drawn at each visit for safety\nmonitoring; additional fasting blood specimens will be drawn at Visits 2, 3, 5 and 6 for the research\nbiospecimen repository. A repeat FDG PET-CT scan will be performed at 24 weeks.\n3.6 Subject Retention\nWe aim to have a 90% retention rate in order to meet the guidelines established by the NIH. Once\nenrolled, a proactive plan for retention will be implemented that includes elements such as regular\nphone and mailed reminders for each study visit, parking and meal vouchers, complimentary items such\nas pens and canvas totes with the study logo, birthday and holiday cards, etc. Arguably, most\nimportantly, we will train sites to follow major principles and commonly used strategies to maximize\nretention and minimize loss to follow-up. These are outlined in detail in the MOOP and include building\nsubject relations and subject satisfaction, with the study coordinator taking a central role in this effort,\nemphasizing the importance of congeniality, respectfulness and friendliness in interactions with\nparticipants.\n\nSubject Withdrawal\nAll subjects receive active therapy and the trial is relatively short in duration; thus, we anticipate few\nwithdrawals and/or cross-overs. Furthermore, the ability to titrate the regimens will limit withdrawal\nand/or cross-over. As noted above, great effort will be made to retain subjects in the study.\nNonetheless, subjects have the right to refuse treatment or completely withdraw from the study at any\ntime for any reason. An explanation of why the subject is withdrawing from the study should be\nrecorded on the withdrawal eCRF. The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the\nstudy treatment in the event of AE, protocol violations, administrative reasons, or for other reasons.\nWhen applicable, subjects should be informed of circumstances under which their participation may be\nterminated by the investigator without the subject's consent. Any administrative or other reasons for\nwithdrawal must be documented and explained to the subject. If the reason for removal of a subject\nfrom the study is an adverse event, the principal specific event will be recorded on the CRF. The subject\nshould be followed until the AE has resolved. If it appears that a subject is lost to follow-up, the\ninvestigator must attempt to contact the subject or a responsible relative by telephone, to determine if\nany new AEs occurred, follow-up of any ongoing AE, and to establish as completely as possible the\nreason for the withdrawal.\n\nStudy treatment may be discontinued for any subject who experiences any of the following:\n• Extreme laboratory value (see Section 4.5.1 Abnormal Lab Values)\n• Malignancy other than basal or squamous cell\n• Repeated subject non-compliance or loss to follow-up.\n• The subject withdraws consent\n• The investigator or DSMB believes it is in the best interest of the subject\n• The study is terminated\nIf study treatment is discontinued (e.g., for an adverse event) and there is no safety issue precluding it,\nthe subject will be asked to return for the follow-up FDG PET/CT scan if he/she has received at least\neight weeks of the randomized treatment prior to withdrawal.\nIn addition, if the subject decides to withdraw from treatment assignment before trial completion, the\nsubject will be asked to come in for a follow-up FDG PET/CT scan within 2 weeks of stopping their\nrandomized treatment assignment and before initiating any new treatment. Subjects will only be asked\nto come for a follow-up FDG PET/CT if they have been on the trial assigned treatment for at least 8\nweeks. If they have been on less than 8 weeks of study treatment before wanting to withdraw, they will\nnot undergo a second scan.\nIf the subject withdraws consent, all study related visits, exams, procedures and data collection are\nterminated.\n29\n3.8 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study\nThis study may be suspended or prematurely terminated by the DSMB or by the NIH if there is sufficient\nreasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination,\nwill be provided by the suspending or terminating party to investigators, funding agency and regulatory\nauthorities. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the principal investigator will\npromptly inform the IRB and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. 7.3 Study Design\nTARGET is a randomized, open-label, multi-center trial. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated,\n1:1, to TNFi + MTX or triple therapy. Baseline imaging will be done at the time of randomization and\nsubjects will be followed for 6 months, at which time the follow-up imaging will be done.
315	2018-03-23	55	\N	\N	Improving the Detection of STIs in the Pediatric Emergency Department: A Pragmatic Trial	STI Screening	6	Adolescents are disproportionately affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and often access the\nemergency department (ED) for care. Because the ED may serve an at-risk population who may otherwise be\ndifficult to reach, identifying the most clinically efficient and cost-effective method by which to deliver this\npreventive health service is urgently needed. This multicenter comparative effectiveness pragmatic trial seeks\nto compare a targeted screening strategy (screening only those disclosing high risk sexual behavior) to a\nuniversally-offered screening strategy (offered to all, regardless of risk). We will use an innovative process of\nincorporating patient-reported data into the electronic health record to provide clinical decision support for STI\ntesting that is both patient and clinician focused. This study will contribute to the evidence base that informs\nthe development of cost-effective and sustainable STI screening programs that can be successfully integrated\nin to the clinical workflow of the ED.	Purpose: The goal of this study is to determine the most clinically effective and cost-effective STI screening approach for adolescents when implemented in a real-world emergency department setting through a pragmatic trial.  \n\nDesign: workflow analyses which will then inform the implementation of a pragmatic multicenter trial using stepped wedge design where a targeted or universally offered STI screening protocol will be sequentially rolled-out to sites over multiple time periods. The order of the the initial intervention will be randomly assigned. By the end of the study, each site will have data collected at baseline, during implementation of a universally offered STi screening strategy, and during implementation of a targeted STI screening strategy.	To determine the most clinically and cost effective STI screening strategy when comparing targeted and universally offered approaches.	1) Workflow Analyses: The primary outcome will be workflow process maps from the patient's perspective that\nillustrate the specific tasks performed by clinicians, the flow of information between patients and clinicians, and\nthe interactions between patients, clinicians, and technology (e.g. devices and EHRs). The process maps will\nidentify areas where new technology and processes can be introduced.\n2) Pragmatic RCT: Our primary outcome measure will be GC/CT testing and detection rates per 1000 eligible\npatients during each 2-week period. We will compare these rates among the usual care, targeted screening,\nand the universally offered GC/CT screening strategies. Secondary outcomes will include a comparison of\nGC/CT positive rates between patients in the high and low risk sexual strata (determined by the patient entered\nSHS) as well as the proportion of positive GC/CT cases successfully treated within 14 days. Process measures\nwill include length of ED stay for each eligible patient during each phase and technological malfunctions during\nthe targeted and universally offered STI screening phases. Additionally, we will measure the proportion of\npatients who agreed to be tested for GC/CT, and the proportion of visits during which the clinician followed the\nCDS recommendations. These will be measured overall and by STI risk strata.\n3) Cost-effectiveness analysis: Costs will be captured in 2017 U.S. dollars. For the simple decision analytic\nmodel, effectiveness will be measured as STIs detected. For the more detailed decision model, we will use\nquality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to capture the impact of STI complications occurring or being averted due\nto screening and subsequent treatment. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be in units of\ndollars spent per STI detected in the simple model and dollars spent per QALY gained in the detailed model.	2	We will include all male and female patients 15-21 years of age seeking emergency department care, regardless of their chief complaint, and exclude only those patients who are unable to understand English or Spanish, who are critically ill, have cognitive impairment or altered mental status, or who would be unable to provide consent for completion of the SHS and STI screening. The study population will be limited to those patients available from the six sites during the specified collection time periods.	The study will be conducted at each of the 6 participating PECARN pediatric EDs, which include Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus, OH), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA), Lurie Children's Hospital (Chicago, IL), Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI), Denver Children's Hospital (Denver, CO), and Texas Children's Hospital (Houston, TX).	Once the ideal workflow strategy is identified at each individual site, all participants in both the targeted and universally offered screening phases will use a handheld tablet device to provide electronic informed consent for participation (Figure 7). All participants will complete the previously developed and validated ACASI SHS containing questions regarding their personal sexual health history.80 The PROs tool will risk-stratify patients for STIs based on their reported sexual experience and/or presence of STI-related symptoms. Using the tablet device, patients will also provide consent for clinician-ordered STI testing (urine-based GC/CT). This will provide clinicians real-time EHR-integrated decision support for GC/CT testing. Since this is a pragmatic trial, the exact process of distributing tablets may differ by site and will be further clarified during the workflow analyses. In Dr. Reed's study, registration staff were responsible for tablet distribution,22 however, at other sites, staff responsible for distribution may include the triage or bedside nurse depending on results of the workflow analyses. The electronic informed consent document will contain information about the study. Should questions arise, RCs will be available to answer more detailed questions. Research staff are available at each participating ED up to 16 hours per weekday and between 8-16 hours on weekends. During hours without RC presence, there will be a CITI-trained clinical provider present to answer questions. Reasons for not offering the tablet will be recorded by the ED staff. Furthermore, if adolescents decline study participation, a reason for refusal will also be recorded on the tablet.\na) Targeted screening: During the targeted screening intervention, data from the SHS will be integrated into the EHR and will provide CDS for GC/CT testing based on SHS-calculated STI risk (developed and validated by Dr. Goyal).19 Patients will be classified as at high risk for STIs if they disclose being sexually active and have either the presence of STI-related symptoms or any of the following high risk behaviors: more than 1 sexual partner in the last 3 months, no condom use during last sex, prior history of STI. Patients will be classified as at risk if they disclose being sexually active but do not disclose having any STI-related symptoms or any high-risk sexual behaviors. Patients will be classified as at low risk if they deny any history of sexual activity (see preliminary data for STI positivity rates by risk strata). When patients classify as at high risk, clinicians will receive CDS that STI testing is "highly recommended"; when they care for patients who classify as at risk, they will receive CDS that STI testing is "recommended"; when caring for patients who classify as at low risk, they will receive CDS that STI testing "is not necessary at this time." If the clinician chooses to follow the recommendation for screening based on patient's risk assessment, and the patient consents to testing on the tablet device, urine GC/CT testing will be performed. \t\nb) Universally offered screening: During the universally offered screening intervention, STI screening will be offered to all eligible adolescents, regardless of risk. All eligible patients will also complete the SHS, will be informed of the CDC GC/CT testing recommendations and then be given the option to decline STI testing using the tablet device. During this phase, the SHS results will not be available to the clinician. STI testing recommendations will be based only on the patient's decision to undergo GC/CT testing. Like the process followed in the targeted screening phase, if the clinician follows the CDS that informs the clinician that the patient agreed to GC/CT screening and consequently orders testing, urine GC/CT testing will be performed.\nc) Both approaches: If the patient is at risk for STIs and declines GC/CT testing, or the patient simply declines GC/CT testing on the tablet but the clinician believes the patient should be tested, the clinician will have the opportunity to engage in a shared decision-making process with the patient as per routine clinical care. Alternatively, if the clinician declines the CDS GC/CT testing recommendations, he/she will be asked to electronically document the reason the CDS is not being followed. All patients who test positive for an STI will be notified of their results and provided treatment based on each site's standard clinical processes for result notification and treatment. Among all patients tested for GC/CT, the associated primary care clinician (PCP) will be informed of the testing and results via existing communication methodologies including Epic in-basket messages, faxes, or other electronic communication methods, and both patients and clinicians will be encouraged to schedule outpatient follow-up appointments. Medical staff, including faculty, clinical trainees, nurses and other medical support staff, will be educated about each screening intervention prior to implementation and with monthly reminders, through in person staff meetings, emails, and Epic job aids. Clinical staff at each participating institution are familiar with EHR-derived CDS for other clinical processes.	36 months	Intervention during consists of only 1 visit; there is no follow-up period.	\N	\N	\N
20	2016-11-16	99	\N	\N	Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Consortium U24 Application	Alzheimer's study	\N	Objective: To develop a clinical trials network infrastructure to optimally advance the development, planning, coordination and execution of  state-of-the-art trials in Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias.    We intend to support 5-7 trials over the 5 year period (2017-2022), with the goal of advancing the design, methods, outcome measures and knowledge generation, as well as data sharing/knowledge exchange from these trials. This network builds on the legacy contributions of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) which has successfully completed 27 clinical trials with over 6000 research participants from 1991-present. This ACTC network will be the successor of the ADCS, and will take advantage of the legacy contributions and data, coupled to a vision of state-of-the-art trials with novel designs, methods, recruitment strategies, community engagement, and outcome measures.      The trials themselves are not part of the ACTC application and will be selected from those successfully peer reviewed and funded through the NIH. In turn, the exact composition of the trials that will be conducted is not presently known. However, the NIA, who is funding the network, expects that it will award 5-7 trials under the U grant with potential for other important trial collaborations given the network's unique positioning in the field.    Our development strategy, has several important components:    a) Proof of concept trial emphasis: we hypothesize that many of the ever increasing number of failed later stage trials result from a failure to achieve proof of concept in earlier stage trials with the requisite pharmacokinetic,  pharmacodynamic and biomarker response with measurable benefits on elements of the disease process. We will emphasize POC trials in this ACTC program    b) Diversify targets: While pursuing the leading amyloid hypothesis of AD, the focus of clinical trials in the field has been very narrow. The failure of multiple amyloid lowering programs with a diversity of targets, leads to the hypothesis that this single target will not suffice and diversification of targets is needed. We hypothesize that novel targets and combination treatments will be necessary for therapeutic success	As outlined above, we do not know the nature of the 5-7 clinical trials that NIA will be funding for the ACTC to conduct.    To address the study design from a general standpoint, we expect that the pharmaceutical trials will be randomized double blind placebo controlled with sample size to have 80-90% power to detect treatment differences on the primary outcome measures with two sided alpha value of 0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons. We intend to undertake novel designs including adaptive clinical trials, seamless phase 1-2 designs and platform trials conducted with master protocol and with shared placebo controlled arms. For the public health interventions, we will implement the most suitable outcomes and designs to test multimodal lifestyle interventions and combination approaches. Our goal will be to have suitable trial designs for these interventions including factorial  or  adaptive randomization which may allow ascertainment of treatment arms with and without efficacy and with determination of clinical important endpoints.	Aim 1. Develop the network infrastructure to optimally advance the development, planning, coordination and execution of 5-7 ACTC clinical trials during the funding period  a)    Provide effective and timely design, methodology, outcome measure planning, and support for clinical trials being planned collaboratively with the ACTC   b)    To coordinate and execute trials approved by NIA/ACTC with tracking metrics and accountability for all stages from start up to data lock to primary publications   c)    To improve clinical trial start up timelines using master trial agreements, central IRB, central contracting, dedicated protocol development resources and enhanced site coordination with ACTC supported personnel at both the coordinating center and the site.     Aim 2: To establish the ACTC network structure with a hub and spoke model to allow rapid scale up for larger trials and capacity for diverse recruitment to reflect societal composition  a)    To have hubs provide oversight and integrated coordination of satellite activities  b)    To provide training and educational programs for fellows, post docs, new investigators, with opportunity for investigator leadership development.     Aim 3: To advance an ACTC strategy for drug development that addresses the lack of therapeutic success of the past 15 years, and leverages the unique capabilities of the network through  a)    Innovative trial designs and methods including adaptive techniques, seamless designs  b)    Priority/Focus on biomarker and clinical proof of concept trials and diversity of validated targets for testing     Aim 4: For ACTC to be a rapid learning and data/sample sharing network to advance the broader scientific community needs for AD clinical trials progress  a)    Establish biorepository at NCRAD to enable integrated approach between AD and other neurodegenerative dementias  b)    Catalogue and mobilize the legacy data of the ADCS to benefit ACTC data sharing and trial design  c)    Advance the electronic data platforms to support broader and more timely community access    Aim 6: Improve efficiencies to achieve best in class metrics in the following areas:  a)    Time from project funding to protocol completion  b)    Time from protocol completion to first patient first visit  c)    Time to complete recruitment  d)    Time from last patient last visit to data lock  e)    Time from data lock to top line results and primary publication  f)     Time to data sharing of trial data including prerandomization and post randomization results	At this time, the ACTC does not know the interventions that will be investigated in the 5-7 NIA funded trials that will be conducted between 2017-2022. The primary endpoint will be determined based on the trial design and the intended therapeutic effect. As we will be working across phases of development, we would generally anticipate that for phase 1 we would have safety and PK/PD as primary outcomes, For Phase 2A, the primary outcomes would be safety, PK and target engagement with evidence of  a target biomarker response. For Phase 2B, clinical proof of concept trials we would focus the primary endpoints on cognition and ADL. For phase 3 disease modifying we would be looking for cognition and ADLs benefits as primary endpoint.      For public health interventions, time to disability, dementia, cognitive decline, would be relevant primary outcomes, as would other 'time to' outcomes. We would also foresee an approach of stage gating where a cognitive benefit might be taken as the first study outcome as a stage gate to a longer term followup with more meaningful outcome in rate of functional decline, or incidence of dementia.	\N	As the interventions being tested within the 5-7 clinical trials are not known to the ACTC it is not possible to specify the entry criteria. In general, the criteria will be fit for purpose. For example, in the prevention trials a population of asymptomatic at risk would include those with biomarkers indicative of the presence of the underlying pathology of AD, while for mild to moderate AD, a diagnosis consistent with AD dementia, with ranges of cognitive and functional disability would define inclusion. Depending on the putative mechanism of action, there would be adjudication on the inclusion/exclusion of cerebrovascular disease, parkinsonian features and presence of lewy body features as well as frontal behavioral features.    As outlined above we will have the capability of testing across the spectrum of cognition with aging from those entirely asymptomatic for preventive interventions to those in the early symptomatic stages of AD, and then through the dementia phases to the severely affected required skilled care.	Not provided	At this time, the ACTC does not know the interventions that will be investigated in the 5-7 NIA funded trials that will be conducted between 2017-2022. The expectation is that there will be pharmaceuticals tested against known and validated targets, against novel targets, as well as with repurposed medications. For the non pharmaceutical trials, the expectation is that these will focus on lifestyle interventions including vascular risk factors, diet, physical and cognitive training.	Not provided	Not provided	At this time, the ACTC does not know the interventions that will be investigated in the 5-7 NIA funded trials that will be conducted between 2017-2022. As such it is not possible to know across the network of up to 80 sites whether there will be any conflicts to disclose. However, the ADCS as an established and currently funded network, has important policies in place around disclosure and potential conflict of interest. All members must provide a full written disclosure at least annually. For these who attend network meetings a written disclosure is again made ahead of each meeting (up to 3-4/annum). As PI of the network I not only make regular disclosures to the full network and NIA but also extra detailed disclosures around any potential conflict with companies or partners in the research that the network is undertaking.	Not provided	We attach a document which provides a strawman view of our best estimates of trial phases, sample sizes, and timelines.    Diversity recruitment is a featured goal of this RFA and we are devising novel approaches to achieve this. Our network construction with hub and spokes will enable many different community settings to participate and reflect back our population demographics within the trials. We will be partnering with the CTSAs, and the Global Alzheimer Platform to have broad community engagement and will be undertaking significant efforts to have the voice of those affected and at risk within the research process from beginning to end.
463	2019-03-05	55	\N	t	Pharmacokinetics of sedatives - Understanding a modifiable risk factor for pediatric delirium	Pharmacology of sedatives in pediatric delirium	6	Pediatric delirium has been strongly linked to the administration of sedatives in critically-ill children by observational studies. However, the pharmacological basis for this association has never been determined. This study intends to determine the association between clearance of 4 commonly administered sedatives (midazolam, dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, morphine) and pediatric delirium in children with acute respiratory failure.	Prospective, observational study of children with acute respiratory failure in 3 Pediatric ICUs (Children's National Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center) will be enrolled within the first 24 hours of institution of mechanical ventilation and administration of one of the 4 sedative medications. Serum will be collected every 12 hours until the child is extubated, up to a total of 5 days. Serum will be shipped to the University of Pittsburgh for analysis of metabolites of the sedative agents.	Specific Aim 1: Model pharmacokinetics of midazolam to determine the association between dose-concentration relationships and delirium.\nDetermine serum concentrations of midazolam (Aim 1.1) and total systemic clearances (Aim 1.2) and their association with development of sedation-related delirium. \nWe hypothesize that increased serum concentrations and decreased total systemic clearance of midazolam prior to the development of delirium will be observed in children who develop delirium. \n\nSpecific Aim 2: Model pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine to determine the association between dose-concentration relationships and delirium prevention.\nDetermine the serum concentrations of dexmedetomidine (Aim 2.1) and total systemic clearances (Aim 2.2) and their association with prevention of sedation-related delirium. \nWe hypothesize that specific target serum concentrations of dexmedetomidine may be protective, and decrease incidence of delirium. \n\nSpecific Aim 3: Model pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and morphine to determine the association between dose-concentration relationships and delirium.\nDetermine the serum concentrations of fentanyl (Aim 3.1.a) and morphine (Aim 3.1.b) and total systemic clearances (Aims 3.2.a, 3.2.b) and their association with sedation-related delirium.\nWe hypothesize that neither opiate will be associated with development of delirium.	Primary endpoints: Development of sedation-induced delirium (CAPD > 9; exposure to sedative medication; no other identifiable cause of altered consciousness), serum concentrations and clearance of the 4 sedative medications.	2	age < 18 y; respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation by endotracheal tube - expected to stay intubated for at least 3 days; administration of one of four sedative/analgesics (dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, midazolam, morphine)	Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC\nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA\nNew York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY	Not applicable.	60 months + 12 months of an anticipated no-cost extension for completion of all data analysis.	5 days	Grant from NIH with anticipated funding date of September 2019	Statistical plan is completed by study personnel - this application if for sIRB only.

214	2017-10-05	5	\N	\N	Characterizing uveitis by gene expression	Characterizing uveitis by gene expression	6	The gene expression profile for 4 important causes of uveitis: sarcoidosis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, and tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis. We will determine if the profiles have adequate sensitivity and specificity to become diagnostic tools. We hypothesize that many forms of uveitis share expression of common RNA transcripts. We will segregate subjects with idiopathic uveitis on the basis of gene expression and validate this classification by determining if the clinical phenotype of the uveitis fits the gene expression profile. We will distinguish transcripts that are indicative of the phenotype in contrast to transcripts that are indicative of the disease activity.	Observational. This study will collect blood from subjects to conduct gene expression profiles.	Using RNA Seq technology, establish the peripheral blood gene expression profiles for specific known forms of uveitis which include ankylosing spondylitis (AS), sarcoidosis, Crohn's Disease, and tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU).  We will test the hypothesis that each disease has a distinct pattern of gene expression reflected in the blood transcriptome. These data will also be used to test the hypothesis that patients who develop uveitis from different etiologies nonetheless share the expression of a subset of common transcripts that represent a "uveitis" signature.\n\nTest the hypothesis that a subset of patients with "idiopathic uveitis" has a gene expression profile that closely resembles the gene expression profile of a known subtype of uveitis such as ankylosing spondylitis, sarcoidosis, Crohn's Disease, or TINU.\n\nUsing longitudinal data, test the hypotheses that a component of disease-associated gene expression profiles is relatively stable over time and minimally affected by systemic medications, while another component reflects disease activity and will be affected by medications.	Primary\n1)\tGene expression signatures for each of the known forms of uveitis\n2)\tGene expression signatures for subsets of idiopathic uveitis\n3)\tDistinction between disease-associated gene expression profiles that are relatively stable over time and minimally affected by systemic medications versus others that reflect disease activity and are minimally affected by medication\nSecondary\n1)\tComparison of the idiopathic subsets with the known disease profiles\n2)\tInterpretation with respect to potential therapeutic options	1	Inclusion criteria are simply that the subject has one of the diseases to be studied or is a noninflamed control and that we obtain adequate blood for extracting useful RNA.  An enrolled subject would be excluded if we did not obtain satisfactory RNA or if further evaluation of the medical records raised doubt about the subject's diagnosis.  Data collected for excluded subjects will be retained for possible separate analysis.	Most of the participants will be enrolled at the Oregon Health & Science University.  To speed the recruitment process of less common diseases, some of the participants will be recruited from ~6 other institutions within the United States.  Each of our collaborators is a highly respected expert in the diagnosis and treatment of uveitis.\n\nOregon Health and Science University, Portland OR\nLegacy Health, Portland OR\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle WA\nCleveland Clinic, Cleveland OH\nUniversity of Utah, Salt Lake City UT\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles CA\nBirmingham Alabama, AL	There is no intervention in this study. Observational only.	48 months - The first 2 aims and sample collection for the 3rd aim should be completed during the current 3-years of funding.  Analysis of the samples for aim 3 will require an additional year and procurement of additional funding.	The involvement of ~90% of the subjects will be limited to a single blood draw.  The other subjects will have 3 blood draws about 18 months apart.	\N	Multidimensional scaling plot using principal coordinate, hierarchical clustering and other graphical methods will be employed to explore gene expression profiles and demographic and clinical data. Simple statistical tests will be done with chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, or Student's t-test as appropriate. RNA Seq data, sequence alignment data in the BAM format will be imported into R and normalized by the trimmed mean of M-values method (TMM)61 , and then transformed by voom method 62 for further analysis. After data preprocessing, linear models will be employed for differential expression analyses while accounting for demographic and clinical variables. An empirical Bayes method 63, false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for p-values and removing unwanted variation (RUVSeq) 64 for adjusting batch differences will be incorporated into the linear models as needed. The voom-limma pipeline is robust and fast, and has been found to be one of the best for RNA Seq data analysis 65.  The voom transformation converts counts to log-counts per million with associated precision weights and the transformed data can be analyzed as if it is continuous data like microarray data. We will use 'rsubread', 'edgeR', 'limma' and 'RUVSeq' packages of Bioconductor 66 in the R project for statistical computing 67. The voom transformed sequence reads for a gene will be deemed to reveal differential expression in mRNA levels when its mean signal differs by more than ±1.5-fold with a FDR adjusted p-value <0.05. The functional annotation and pathways analyses of differentially expressed genes will be performed with DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) 68 and GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) 69 software.	\N
354	2018-06-21	7	\N	\N	A Phase 2a, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial of TT301/MW189 after Acute Traumatic Brain Injury	TT301/MW189 Phase 2a trial	2	TT301/MW189, a small molecule, is being developed for the treatment of TBI. The development program is based on nonclinical evidence that TT301/MW189 reduces the recruitment of activated microglia, reduces cerebral edema, and improves motor skills and neurocognitive outcomes in animal models of neuroinflammatory disorders. This study will assess the safety and tolerability of TT301/MW189 in injured patients and provide proof-of-concept pharmacodynamics endpoint results.	A Phase 2a, Multi-Center, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study of TT301/MW189 after Acute Traumatic Brain Injury. A multi-center study with 6 to 8 sites, assuming recruitment of ~1 subject per month per site. Patients will be randomized to drug or placebo in a 1:1 ratio; n=25/group. The study will recruit a total of 50 subjects (25 drug, 25 placebo), ages 18-65 years, with severe non-penetrating, traumatic closed head injury (iGCS score of 4-8), with EVD. First dose of study drug or placebo initiated iv within 6h of injury. Drug or placebo (saline vehicle) will be administered by short (~20 min) iv infusion q12 from days 1-5 inclusive. Blood (drawn before intervention and every 24h thereafter) and CSF (collected before intervention, q4 on day 1, then q24 on days 2-7) will be collected and analyzed for protein profiles that reflect inflammatory glial activation and neuronal dysfunction biomarkers.\nSafety parameters monitored; PK evaluated. CSF and blood collected at specified times and analyzed for protein profiles that reflect inflammatory glial activation and neuronal dysfunction. Secondary clinical endpoints will be monitored to determine if any trends in functional outcome are evident. \nScreening, day 7, discharge, 30-day and 90-day. Barthel Index (BI): test of ability to perform activities of daily living.\nScreening, day 7, discharge, 30-day and 90 day clinical exam (GOS-E).	Primary aims of the trial: \nTo assess the safety and tolerability of TT301/MW189 when administered iv to patients with non-penetrating traumatic closed head injury, with clinical indication for an external ventricular drain (EVD). Intravenous (iv) administration of drug or placebo q12 (every 12 hrs) x 10 doses (first dose initiated within 6 hours of injury).\n\nSecondary aims: \nExploratory pharmacodynamics (PD) endpoints: Determine whether the profile of selected CSF or serum inflammatory cytokine biomarkers is modulated by TT301/MW189 administration.  Monitor secondary clinical endpoints at the 30-day and 90-day follow-up visits to assess functional outcome. It should be noted that this pilot study is not powered for efficacy; nevertheless, the clinical assessments may provide some suggestive evidence for a functional effect of drug and will help inform the design of future larger trials.	Safety parameters monitored; PK evaluated. CSF and blood collected at specified\ntimes and analyzed for protein profiles that reflect inflammatory glial activation and\nneuronal dysfunction (including cytokines, chemokines, GFAP, UCH-L1).\nSecondary clinical endpoints will include:\n• Early neurological deterioration: usually defined as a decrease in Glascow\nComa Score of >=2 points\n• Therapeutic intensity for management of intracranial hypertension (TIL;\nMaset, 1987).	1	Inclusion Criteria:\nMale and female, ages 18-65 years, severe brain injury (iGCS of 4-8), nonpenetrating\ntraumatic closed head injury, presence of ventricular catheter, able to\ninitiate study drug administration within 6h from time of injury.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\nNon-survivable injury; penetrating traumatic brain injury; status epilepticus on\narrival; subjects with severe ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure,\nmyocardial infarction, spinal cord injury, cancer or any other severe co-morbidities;\nsubjects who are on immunosuppressants or chronic anti-inflammatory drugs;\nprisoner or ward of state; positive pregnancy test.	Level 1 trauma centers across United States.	TT301/MW189 is a small molecule drug candidate developed as a selective suppressor of disease- and injury-induced glia proinflammatory cytokine overproduction associated with destructive glia inflammation/ neuron dysfunction cycles, and their long-term neurotoxic effects. Evidence from clinical studies and preclinical animal models suggest the importance of proinflammatory cytokine overproduction from activated glia as a potential driving force for pathology progression in TBI. In both animal models and human head injury patients, TBI induces a robust increase in cytokine levels in the brain that occurs in the first several hours to days after insult and then subsides. There is extensive evidence that this acute cytokine surge is a key contributor to subsequent synaptic and cognitive dysfunction and other neurologic sequelae of TBI.  This mechanistic linkage, and the attractive therapeutic time window of hours post-insult, provide a rational therapeutic target for intervention in the trauma center setting. \nTT301/MW189 is being developed for the treatment of TBI. The development program is based on nonclinical evidence that the drug reduces the recruitment of activated microglia, reduces cerebral edema, and improves motor skills and neurocognitive outcomes in animal models of neuroinflammatory disorders (TBI, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and Alzheimer's disease) (see James et al., 2012). TT301/MW189 has completed the preclinical drug development process; IND-enabling pharmacokinetic/ toxicology studies revealed no significant liabilities. Importantly, TT301/MW189 has also completed two phase 1a human clinical trials with no safety issues after single doses. TT301/MW189 is currently undergoing a phase 1b multiple ascending dose clinical trial in healthy human volunteers (NCT02942771).	Total timeframe for the study is estimated to be 18 - 24 months (4-5 months start-up (IRB, investigator meeting, on-site initiation, contracts etc), 9-11 months active recruitment, 5-8 months database lock, close out analysis).	7 days in-patient, 30 day and 90 day follow-up visits	Scientific Founder of Northwestern start-up, ImmunoChem Therapeutics LLC, formed to commercialize the technology.	This trial is proposed to randomize 25 patients each to the placebo and active drug arms (50 patients total). Subjects will be administered drug or placebo for 5 days. This estimated sample size makes assumptions about the behavior of cytokines after injury and the anticipated effect of drug. Based on analysis of the literature and using IL-1β as a representative cytokine, the sample size of 25 per group has 80% power to show that the drug reduces the peak concentration of IL-1β by 66% (from 9.9 to 3.3, with standard deviation 8.2) based on the power of a two sample t-test (one tailed test of significance at the 0.05 level).\nThis study will measure changes in inflammatory cytokine profiles in CSF over time.  Since CSF samples will be collected over time, a repeated measure analysis of variance will be constructed to compare the profile of mean response for each biomarker over time between the two arms. Since cytokine values tend to be right skewed especially among injured subjects, log transformation may be needed for some of these endpoints. Since cytokines are influenced by the presence of other injuries or co-morbidities, these will be included as potential covariates in the analysis. If the log transformation fails to yield satisfactory results, then an analysis based on ranks will be considered as well. Although there are many potential endpoints, no adjustment for control of the Type I error rate will be made since this is an exploratory study. However, interpretation of significant results will acknowledge this as a potential limitation of the findings. Statistical significance will be determined at the 0.05 level throughout.	\N
402	2018-09-19	100	\N	t	Bio-Repository to Evaluate the Acute to Chronic Pain Transition (BREAC Pain)	BREAC Pain	6	Our hypothesis is that peri-trauma biopsychosocial profiles predict post-fracture outcomes including acute pain, persistent pain (>3 months), physical function, brain and cognitive function, and quality of life. We will enroll patients during their initial Emergency Department (ED) visit for acute long bone fracture, and obtain baseline psychosocial survey information, non-invasive sensory measurements, blood samples for biomarker analysis, and fMRI brain imaging within the first 2 weeks of visit. Patients will be followed longitudinally, and follow up survey, sensory, biomarker and imaging data will be obtained at 3 months and 6 months after injury for analysis of predictors of chronic pain.	This observational study will prospectively enroll 1800 patients in EDs across 8-10 sites, identified by CRCs as adults with X-ray confirmed isolated long bone fracture sustained <48 hours ago. Patient contact information, baseline psychosocial survey data, sensory measurements, and blood samples will be obtained in the ED, and brain fMRI will be scheduled within 2 weeks. Patients will return at 3 and 6 months after injury for follow up survey, sensory, biomarker and imaging data. Biospecimens will be stored in secure facilities (e.g. Maixner lab) until sent to the NIH-assigned ODGC. Survey and sensory data will be stored in Redcap.	The objective is to serve as a Multisite Clinical Center (MCC) to recruit an acute long bone fracture pain cohort at onset of the acute pain event while patients are in the ED. Our specific goals will be to deliver, monitor, and record usual pain care including opioid and other analgesic use; assess patients for study-determined characteristics including detailed patient reported outcomes (historical data such as previous surgeries, trauma, substance abuse, concurrent pain conditions, depression, somatization tendencies, support system, etc); and to perform brain imaging, sensory tests, and collect biospecimens at onset of acute pain and follow-up (time = 0, 3 months, and 6 months). The goal as MCC is to implement the enrollment and multimodal longitudinal assessment of a large cohort of patients with acute pain from a musculoskeletal trauma to identify candidate biomarkers and combine them into biosignatures predictive of the susceptibility or resilience to the development of chronic pain. \nAs one of two MCCs, our work will be coordinated with NIH-determined Omics Data Generation Centers (ODGCs), a Data Integration Resource Center (DIRC), and a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) into an overall A2CPS program. Centers will work together as a consortium with strong communication and cooperation.	The candidate biomarkers to be tested as primary outcomes in the two MCCs will be selected by a panel of external experts, consortium awardees, and NIH staff, who will consider the most promising biomarkers of transition or resilience to chronic pain based on current evidence. The size of the acute fracture cohort is expected to be approximately 1800 patients, and the number of study biomarkers identified as primary study outcomes is expected to be approximately 40, based on an NIH power analysis calculation. Outcome measures include acute pain, persistent pain (>3 months), physical function, brain and cognitive function, and quality of life.	1	Inclusion criteria: Adults age 18+ years, ED patients, isolated long bone fracture confirmed on X-ray, acute = sustained within 48 hours of visit.  \nExclusion criteria: children <18 years, poly-trauma (only if additional injury is more severe than simple contusion, laceration, sprain/strain, e.g. multiple fractures, solid organ injury, TBI), no contact information for follow up	8-10 Emergency Department sites with access to MRI, within United States	No interventions, but study subjects will have to provide blood samples, and complete multiple surveys on enrollment and at home via web-based surveys.	36 months+.  Data will be stored as a repository for future analyses beyond the 36 month funded period.	6 months.	\N	The NIH-determined DIRC will develop the statistical plan.	All sites will enroll patients suffering an acute long bone fracture during their ED visit. The grant provides for one year for planning, then 2 years for enrollment. \nIf we have 10 sites, then each site would have to enroll 90 patients per year, or ~8 patients a month. \n2 years- not based on past data, but that is what is required by the grant. \nRecruitment efforts will be essential to meeting enrollment goal.

Hypothesis 2: Personalized guideline recommendations regarding tier 1 therapies for intracranial hypertension and basic aspects of care can be developed across various TBI subtypes.	Proposed study design:  The study will follow and observational cohort design.  Consecutive children who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled at participating hospitals.  Children will be followed for one year.  Follow-up assessments will occur three, six, and twelve months after the injury.	Specific Aim 1         Hypothesis 1.1: After controlling for the confounding effects of patient/disease characteristics by the use of propensity scores and direct adjustment for the first-line intracranial hypertension therapies, decompressive surgery intracranial hypertension will be associated with worse outcomes at 6 months after injury when compared to other second-tier therapies for intracranial hypertension.        Hypothesis 1.2: After controlling for the confounded effects of patient/disease characteristics by the use of propensity scores and direct adjustment for first-line intracranial hypertension therapies, barbiturate coma will be associated with worse outcomes at 6 months after injury when compared to other second-tier therapies for intracranial hypertension.        Hypothesis 1.3: After controlling for patient/disease characteristics and direct adjustment for key variables including the first-line intracranial hypertension therapies, therapeutic hypothermia will be associated with worse outcomes at 6 months after injury when compared to other second-tier therapies for intracranial hypertension.        Hypothesis 1.4: After controlling for patient/disease characteristics and direct adjustment for key variables including the first-line intracranial hypertension therapies, lumbar drainage of cerebrospinal fluid will be associated with worse outcomes at 6 months after injury when compared to other second-tier therapies for intracranial hypertension.[S1]            Specific Aim 2        Hypothesis 2.1: Using propensity scoring to control for the cofounding effects of patient/disease characteristics on the treatments to be examined, girls will exhibit differential responses to first-line therapies for intracranial hypertension (CSF diversion, hyperosmolar therapies, hyperventilation) and basic care (hypoxia, nutrition and glucose) when compared to boys at 6 months after injury.        Hypothesis 2.2: Using propensity scoring to control for the confounding effects of patient/disease characteristics on the treatments to be examined, children with abusive head trauma (AHT) will exhibit differential responses to first-line therapies for intracranial hypertension (CSF diversion, hyperosmolar therapies, hyperventilation) and basic care (hypoxia, nutrition and glucose) when compared to those with accidental injuries at 6 months after injury.        Hypothesis 2.3: Using propensity scoring to control for the confounding effects of patient/disease characteristics on the treatments to be examined, children with GCS of 3 at the time of ICP monitor insertion will exhibit differential responses to first-line therapies for intracranial hypertension (CSF diversion, hyperosmolar therapies, hyperventilation) and basic care (hypoxia, nutrition and glucose) when compared to children with GCS of 4-5 and children with GCS of 6-8 at 6 months after injury.

318	2018-03-23	7	\N	\N	IMPACCT: Infrastructure for musculoskeletal pediatric acute care clinical trials	IMPACCT	6	A well-established and unified pediatric fracture research consortium of many orthopaedic surgeons can provide a synergistic approach to answering multiple clinical questions. The IMPACCT (Infrastructure for Musculoskeletal Pediatric Acute Care Clinical Trials)  is proposing two multicenter study questions on medial epicondyle fractures and distal radius fractures. These two upper extremity fractures have high treatment variation without consensus on care. Our ultimate clinical trial will evaluate two common treatments for these fractures based on patient reported outcome scores (PROMIS Pediatrics Upper Extremity) at one year after the injury. Currently, the IMPACCT Consortium is pursuing an R34 funding mechanism with NIAMS to support the planning phases of a clinical trial on these fractures. We would like to utilize the TIN to assist with proposal development and if funded, the facilitation of the development and running of the trial.	The ultimate clinical trial will evaluate if anatomical reduction of a distal radius or medial epicondyle fracture in kids has better patient reported outcomes than casting the unreduced fracture. Children with these fractures will be prospectively enrolled at participating sites. Subjects will be randomized to either treatment group and followed for 1 year after the injury to obtain patient reported outcome measures. We have a blocking randomization scheme stratified by site with no or very limited expected cross-over because children can only receive one treatment at the time of injury.	The objectives of this proposed planning grant are to complete the necessary clinical trial planning activities and operational aspects of a multicenter trial.\nThese activities include:\n1. Developing the organizational and operational structure of the trials and associated documents like the Manual of Operations and Procedures  \n2. Modeling recruitment plans to establish the feasibility of recruiting sufficient number of subjects \n3. Identifying qualifying sites and planning the site initiation strategy\n4. Initiating IRB submissions and clinical trial agreements with qualifying sites\n5. Developing the data management plan, the data and safety monitoring plan, and data collection system	At the completion of this proposal period for the R34, we expect to have a consortium of sites ready to initiate the proposed trials. We plan to submit a U01 proposal to NIAMS following the completion of the objectives of the R34 planning grant proposal.	2	This section is N/A for the R34 proposal. \n\nParticipants will be selected if they present to a participating site ED with a distal radius fracture or medial epicondyle fracture. Participants must be amenable to randomization. Ages have been selected based on consensus of the IMPACCT consortium that these age ranges present the most pressing need for evidence to guide clinical decision making.	The IMPACCT Consortium currently has 35 members from 33 pediatric hospitals. All hospitals are trauma centers in the United States and Canada affiliated with a university.	The study intervention for the U01 proposal is a procedure that achieves formal anatomical realignment for the fracture. For these upper extremity fractures, patients are either treated by realigning these injuries in their original anatomic position or allowing the fracture fragments to heal in their current positions with cast immobilization and no formal reduction. Currently, there is a high variability in which treatment patients receive, with approximately 50% of patients with a medial epicdondyle fracture going to the OR for formal reduction or just getting a cast in the emergency department. We have high equipoise among our consortium surgeons about which treatment is best for these fractures. Additionally, they are willing to randomize patients between these treatments.	We expect the R34 planning activities to last 18 months.	For the U01 protocol, participants will undergo treatment for their injury which usually consists of 12 weeks of regular follow up with an orthopaedic surgeon to ensure that the fracture is healing appropriately. We will collect patient reported outcomes at 6 months and 1 year after the injury.	There are no conflicts.	We are working with our local CTSA statistician to finalize the plan. Our statistician will be listed as a Co-Investigator on our R34 and U01 proposals.	We are currently working on analyzing retrospective data from sites to determine the enrollment plan and site estimates.
279	2018-02-08	3	\N	\N	Pediatric Emergency Department Implementation of SBIRT	PEDI-SBIRT	6	The goal of this application is to conduct a fully powered Type III hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to investigate a comprehensive strategy to improve pediatric emergency department (ED) screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment for adolescent alcohol use. A secondary aim will examine patient outcomes of the clinical intervention, in this case, alcohol and other drug use and follow-up treatment services received.  We hypothesize that results of this study will demonstrate that a highly scalable implementation strategy, adapted for the ED setting, will improve the fidelity (i.e., the consistency and quality) of SBIRT delivery in pediatric EDs.	Utilizing a stepped wedge design, six pediatric EDs will receive the PEDI-SBIRT implementation strategy, which utilizes a computerized brief intervention.  EDs will enroll 1,008 adolescents who screen positive on the NIAAA two-question screen via the PEDI SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey, in order to assess patient-level data post-discharge.  These participants will complete follow up at 1-3 days on the impressions of SBIRT delivery in the ED, 3 months and 6 months post discharge on AOD use. ED nurses and site leaders will be surveyed on organizational readiness for implementation at four time points.	Primary Aim: Evaluate the effectiveness of the pediatric ED implementation for SBIRT (PEDI-SBIRT) strategy in increasing the occurrence and fidelity of SBIRT delivery at EDs, relative to usual care. \nHypothesis: ED staff, after receiving the PEDI-SBIRT strategy will increase by 30% the proportion of adolescents receiving each element of the SBIRT protocol as indicated:  a) validated AOD screening, and for those screening positive, b) electronic AOD brief intervention (BI), c) review of printout of change plan from electronic BI by ED nursing staff, and d) where indicated (as defined by NIAAA two question screen guidelines) a referral after ED discharge (i.e., continued AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider).\nSecondary Aim 1: Evaluate the effect PEDI-SBIRT has on AOD use at 3 and 6 months following ED discharge. Hypothesis: After the PEDI-SBIRT strategy commences in an ED, adolescents who screen positive on the NIAAA two question screen and receive the electronic BI will report decreased AOD use at both 3 and 6 month follow-ups, compared to adolescents enrolled in the study during the usual care phase. \nSecondary Aim 2: Evaluate whether ED staff's readiness for organizational change mediates the influence of the PEDI-SBIRT on implementation effectiveness (i.e., fidelity of SBIRT delivery). \nHypothesis: The effect of the PEDI-SBIRT strategy on implementation effectiveness will be partially mediated by ED staff's measured change in organizational readiness to change. \nSecondary Aim 3: Evaluate the effect of PEDI-SBIRT on improving linkage to appropriate care (i.e. continued AOD discussion with primary care provider and/or AOD treatment) following ED discharge. \nHypothesis: Adolescents in EDs that receive the PEDI-SBIRT implementation strategy will report higher rates of AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider within 30 days of discharge, compared to usual care	Primary Aim: Implementation Effectiveness: During the 1-3-day follow up, we will administer the Adolescent Perception of SBIRT Services Survey to enrolled patients via REDCap.  Using the NIAAA two-question screen Risk Algorithm, we will calculate site-specific rates for: a) use of NIAAA two-questions screening, and for those screening positive, b) computerized AOD brief intervention (BI), c) review of personalized feedback from computerized BI by ED nursing staff, and d) where indicated, a referral after ED discharge (i.e., continued AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider).  The Adolescent Perception of SBIRT Services Survey was developed by the research team to evaluate patient experience of SBIRT services. This instrument is being utilized in our current R01 (Mello; R01AA025914).\n\nSecondary Aim 1:  AOD Use:  We will administer a modified Project ASSESS battery to determine AOD use of adolescents at baseline as well as at 3 and 6 months following ED discharge. This battery was administered to nearly 5,000 adolescent ED patients in our Project ASSESS study and modified battery will contain measures of alcohol and drug use (Drug Use Questionnaire).  \nSecondary Aim 2: Organizational readiness for implementing change:  Organizational Readiness to Implementing Change, is a 12-item scale which will be implemented to all participating staff at four timepoints (baseline, before the Preparation phase, after the Implementation and Sustainability phases) via REDCap. Staff responses to this scale will be used to create an organizational-level measure of each ED's shared perceptions regarding the extent to which their center has the level of skill, training, time, and resources necessary to implement the SBIRT protocol. This measure has been adapted for the proposed study based on the implementation readiness measure developed by Shea and colleagues.\nSecondary Aim 3: Linkage to Appropriate Care:  During the 3 and 6 months post discharge follow up, we will administer the Adolescent Perception of Post ED SBIRT Services Survey to patients via REDCap.  We define our outcome as the percent of adolescents receiving an AOD referral who report linkage to discussions about AOD with a health care provider and/or AOD treatment at 3 and 6 months	2	Staff:  All ED nurses and the identified site leader(s) from each participating institution will be included in the study.\n\nED patients:  Inclusion/exclusion criteria for ED patients includes:  a) between the ages of 12-17 years; b) treated in one of the participating EDs; c) screened positive for AOD use based on PEDI SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey; d) fluent in English or Spanish; and e) able to provide written assent and parent able to provide written consent.  Exclusion criteria include: in police custody, being evaluated by child protective services, in state custody, ED visit for suicide attempt and any acute conditions that would preclude provision of informed consent (i.e., acute psychosis, altered mental status, cognitive impairment).	6 PECARN sites (TBD)	PEDI-SBIRT Implementation Strategy consists of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment:\nScreening (S). ED patients age 12-17 years will receive the NIAAA two-question screen (and results recorded in the EMR) during their initial evaluation by nursing staff. A template of the NIAAA two-question screen and clinical informatic technical assistance from Co-I Zonfrillo will be provided to each institution to ease institutional EMR integration.  Parents and others will be asked to leave the room during the alcohol screening (and any other sensitive questions for the adolescent).  Asking the two-question screen in private will establish trust and result in more honest answers. The NIAAA Youth Guide risk estimator will be used to determine adolescents' risk level.\nBrief Intervention (BI).  If the teen screens moderate to high risk, the nurse will inform the teen that based on their responses, they will receive a computerized BI.  The nurse will explain that this is an independent activity but will ask for permission to engage parents in a conversation afterwards.  Parent involvement is important in teen BI success and has been linked to better follow through with referral to treatment.  If the teen agrees, the nurses will invite parents back into the room after the computerized intervention, compliment the teen for their honesty and frame his/her wanting to involve the parent positively. Personalized feedback/ referral information will be provided to the teen and parent together.  If teens do not agree, confidentiality will not be violated (unless they are a serious threat to themselves), and personalized feedback/referral information (where appropriate) will only be provided to the teen.  The research team will work with the site leader to design site specific workflows which take into account local and state laws around confidentiality.  This was a successful approach in our past implementation studies, with the majority of teen patients choosing to engage their parent in the conversation.  \nThe nurse assisted computerized BI, e-Check-Up to Go for alcohol (e-CHUG) is designed as a motivational enhancement therapy to motivate teens to reduce their alcohol use.  e-CHUG is divided into three parts: assessment, personalized feedback, and personal reflections. After completing the program, which takes about 25 minutes, the nurse will review personalized feedback which contains information on potential behavior changes based on teen responses, and check in with the adolescent to answer any questions that may have arisen. \nReferral to Treatment (RT). Upon discharge, the nurse will provide the personalized feedback form along with the standard discharge instructions.  Based on recommendations from the NIAAA Youth Guide, those screening moderate risk will be referred back to their primary care provider, and those screening high risk will be referred to their medical home and further AOD treatment resources.  These AOD specific instructions will be incorporated into the discharge instructions based on the patient's NIAAA two-question screen results	Study start up will occur for the first six months of the study.  The study will run from month 6 through month 54.  Institutions will enroll patients during the Usual Care and Sustainability phases (this will vary by institution based on their randomization to the PEDI-SBIRT strategy in the stepped wedge design).  Data analysis will occur from month 54 to month 60.	Patients will be followed for 6 months.	There is nothing to disclose.	Primary Aim: We will report descriptive statistics to summarize each element of the SBIRT. Our primary comparison for each of these will be pre- vs. post-intervention among those who screen positive. We will compare rates using site-6-months as the unit of analysis.  Standard stepped-wedge analysis techniques will be used.  Specifically, the site-month rate will be the outcome in a linear model to examine the effect of receiving the PEDI-SBIRT on the rate of completion of each element.  In the model, we will include an effect for each site, as well as an effect for each 6-month period, which will control for temporal trends.  An intervention effect will be included and we will test for a difference between pre- and post-intervention at a 5% significance level. \n\nSecondary Aims:  We will use a similar stepped-wedge analysis to test for a change in AOD use.  In this case, however, the unit of analysis will be the participant, and we will once again include both site and time effects.  We will also perform a similar analysis on the rate of AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider.  \n\nIn order to explore mediation of ED staff's readiness for organizational change on the effectiveness of PEDI-SBIRT implementation, we will perform the following steps.  First, we will use the model derived in the analysis of the primary aim to create two additional models: (1) a model with ED staff readiness added as a predictor and (2) a model using ED staff readiness to replace adherence rate as the outcome.  Based on the latter model, we will simulate predicted mediator values for each observation under both pre- and post-intervention circumstances.  These predictions will then be used in the first new model to simulate the adherence rate and counterfactual (using ED staff readiness predicted under pre-intervention) corresponding to post-intervention.  The mediation effect is the average of the differences in outcome across all units of analysis.  We will perform repeated simulation to estimate the uncertainty and to test whether the mediation effect is 0.  We will perform sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding.  \n\nPower and Sample Size Considerations: \nPrimary Aim: We plan to enroll at 6 PECARN sites. Based on experience with the ASSESS study, we conservatively anticipate that approximately 4 per month per site will screen positive for alcohol risk, leading to approximately 24 per site per 6-month period.  We believe current rates of adherence to the elements of SBIRT to be near 0. We will conservatively estimate baseline adherence to be 5%.  For the purpose of power calculations, we assume a standard deviation in rates across sites of 8.7%. Based on expected enrollment of 24 per 6 months per site, we will have approximately 80% power to detect a 9.0% difference in adherence rates and 90% power to detect a difference of about 10.8%. Confidence intervals around detection rates in each of the screening strategy groups will be +/- 2-3%.\n\nChange in AOD use:  With approximately 500 participants pre-intervention and 500 post-intervention, we will have 80% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.18 and 90% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.21.  Tanner-Smith and Risser19 (ref) found an effect size (standardized) of about 0.21 for frequency of heavy drinking and 0.14 for quantity of drinking.	\N

Nationally, diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death, and a major cause of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney failure. The prevalence of diabetes is expected to double in the next 20 years, with some of the largest increases occurring in Asian populations. Among recent immigrants with limited English language ability the problem of diabetes is compounded by  lack of access to health care and cultural attitudes and behaviors that can be barriers to effective diabetes management.  To address health disparities in relation to diabetes management, we propose the community-based diabetes care model (C-DCM).  The C-DCM, a mobile technology enabled multi-level intervention, shifts routine diabetes management from within the traditional healthcare system to culturally appropriate community-based services, facilitates and strengthens the relationship with physicians and other providers, and addresses health determinants within family and community contexts. With seed funding from Tufts Health Plan Foundation, we have implemented a pilot study to assess the feasibility of the C-DCM in an immigrant, elderly, Chinese population in Boston's Chinatown in partnership with Greater Boston Chinese Golden Age Center (GBCGAC), a community-based organization. Our model adapted from ongoing program in India (see 'Scientific Rationale') shifts routine chronic care management (e.g. care coordination and self-management support) from primary- and hospital-based care to community-based services, while facilitating and strengthening physician-patient relationships, and addressing social and community issues. As a next step, we propose a multicenter randomized controlled trial to test effectiveness of C-DCM in 1st generation immigrants who belong to one or more U.S. racial/ethnic minority populations.   We have identified two other potential sites one in New York (Chinese Immigrants) and Brownsville Texas (Mexican Immigrants) with high prevalence of diabetes. For example, the prevalence of diabetes in the target population in Brownsville is 30%.  We hypothesize, when compared to clinic/hospital-based 'usual care', the C-DCM will improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs, and thereby motivating payers to cover these services either directly or as part of alternative payment models to reduce health disparities.	We will test the effectiveness of the C-DCM using a community-participatory RCT design. The study will be implemented in 2-phases.    In Phase 1 of the project will establish a Community-Provider Advisory Committee as the locus for community input. This Committee will guide all aspects of the study, participate in decision making regarding study planning, design of implementation plans, interventions and evaluation as well as dissemination of results and planning or sustainability if the C-DCM is shown to be effective.  The Committee will include all stakeholders: patients and family members, providers, and community partners. The stakeholders will be from all sites.  The goal will be to come up with a broad set of intervention principals/protocols for C-DCM, which are applicable to culturally diverse groups, while accommodating specific measures that are relevant to a specific population.         Phase 2 of the study is a multi-site randomized controlled trial in which eligible patients (based on inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Intervention (C-DCM) and Control (clinic-based Usual Care). The total duration of the study will be for 2-years. The baseline and 6-monthly assessments will include: (1) clinical measures (weight, HBA1c,  LDL and blood pressure); (2) self-care behaviors (Diabetes Self- Efficacy, a 10-item scale, which includes medication compliance); (3)  quality of life measures (5 item EuroQol Questionnaire); (4) chronic illness care (Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care Survey is a 20-item patient report instrument); (5) Healthcare utilization (Patients self-reported the number of visits to a physician's office, clinic, hospital emergency room, and hospital admissions); and (6) patients' families (Family Instrumental Support, a 6-item scale; Family Emotional Support, a 6-item scale).  The end of study assessment (2-year assessment) will also include, Cost effectiveness Analysis (by comparing the relative cost and outcomes of the comprehensive intervention to that of Usual Care) and process improvements with the use of mobile technologies (assessing adherence to protocols and the strength of the intervention delivered).	The Primary Aim is to assess the effectiveness of a C-DCM to increase the proportion of patients who are able to achieve goal levels recommended by national guidelines for lipids, blood pressure, HbA1c, and medication compliance. The Secondary Aims are to determine the cost-effectiveness of C-DCM relative to Usual Care, process improvements with the use of mobile technologies and to determine the effectiveness of C-DCM on patient and family perceptions of their chronic illness care and health care utilization.    1.\tPatients randomized to the C-DCM program will have lower HbA1c and higher medication and appointment compliance than those receiving Usual Care.    2.\tPatients and caregivers of patients participating in C-DCM report higher quality of life, greater satisfaction with care, and higher family social support than patients and families in Usual Care.    3.\tWe expect C-DCM to be more cost-effective in achieving the aforementioned outcomes compared to Usual Care.    4.\tBased on process measures, we expect to demonstrate the ability of point-of-care, mobile technologies to facilitate CHW team's adherence to protocols and strengthen the intervention delivered, and provide adequate home-based assessment of end-organ function (retinopathy, neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease).	We propose a multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a C-DCM delivered by CHW teams versus clinic/hospital-based Usual Care in improving diabetes outcomes in immigrant populations.  The outcome that will measure this primary question- proportion of patients that achieve goal levels recommended by national guidelines for lipids, blood pressure, HbA1c, and medication compliance.	1	Adult patients identified will be eligible if they are 1st generation immigrant, belong to one or more U.S. racial/ethnic minority populations, and diabetic with a HbA1c 7% or greater. Patients will be excluded if they have had a serious life-threatening non-cardiac comorbidity with a life expectancy of less than 5 years (AIDS or cancer for example), had a serious physician recorded psychiatric morbidity or neurologic impairment that would preclude participation in their own care. In addition, a family member who either lives with the participant or provides caretaking on a regular basis, will be recruited into the study.	Not provided	We propose a multi-site randomized controlled trial in which patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:  C-DCM  (intervention group) or the clinic-based  Usual Care (control group). In C-DCM the CHW-lead interventions will include (1) community-based services (home-based comprehensive monitoring, self-management support); (2) facilitating and strengthening linkage-to-care (care-coordination, ensuring regular clinic visits and culturally appropriate collective treatment decision making); and (3) addressing socio-environmental  issues  (addressing family contextual issues, increasing awareness in the community to address culture specific beliefs and practices for health promotion and disease prevention, and facilitating linkage to other services that address other social determinants of health such as, housing and  employment).

359	2018-06-28	40	\N	t	A multicenter prospective randomized trial of Seattle biopsy protocol versus wide-area transepithelial sampling in patients with Barrett's esophagus undergoing surveillance (THE SWAT-BE STUDY)	Seattle biopsy protocol versus wide-area transepithelial sampling in Barrett's esophagus	6	Concept and Rationale: Current practice guidelines recommend endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus (BE) patients in an attempt to detect cancer at an early and potentially curable stage. It is recommended that biopsies should be obtained every 1-2 cm along the length of the BE segment with target biopsies from any visible lesions (Seattle protocol). However, there are several issues that limit the effectiveness of this strategy. Adherence to obtaining biopsies using the Seattle protocol is limited in clinical practice. Even when properly performed, this biopsy protocol has significant potential for sampling errors given the limited amount of esophageal epithelium that gets tested and the highly focal and variable distribution of dysplasia and early esophageal adenocarcinoma within the BE segment. There is also significant interobserver and intraobserver variability among community and expert pathologists in the interpretation of dysplasia.\n\nWide-area transepithelial sampling (WATS) with computer-assisted 3-dimensional tissue analysis is a novel, brush biopsy sampling technique that can sample an extensive area of the BE segment. \nStudies conducted thus far have highlighted the adjunctive role of WATS in the surveillance of patients with BE. In a recent randomized controlled trial that included 160 BE patients with and without dysplasia undergoing endoscopy, WATS was associated with an absolute increase in the diagnostic yield of high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/EAC by 14.4% when used as an adjunctive technique to forceps biopsies during surveillance. A recent meta-analysis showed that WATS was associated with an absolute increase of 6.5% (95% CI 2.6-10.4) in a high risk population (prior history of dysplasia) and 2.1% (95% CI 1.4-2.7) in a low-risk population. The diagnosis of BE and associated dysplasia using the WATS technique was also shown to have high interobserver-agreement.\nIt is unknown if the use of WATS along with target biopsies from visible lesions can replace our current Seattle biopsy protocol (substitutive technique).\n\nAnticipated Impact:\nThe proposed study has the potential to result in a paradigm shift in the way sampling is currently performed for patients with BE (associated with numerous limitations). This will impact more than 1% of the adult US population and impact healthcare policies and future guidelines.	Study Design: To maximize the generalizability of results, this randomized controlled trial will be conducted across closed healthcare networks (including the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers) and large community practices. Patients with non-dysplastic BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited. Included patients will undergo both techniques - Seattle protocol and WATS, order of techniques will be randomized. \n \nAll patients will undergo upper endoscopy using high-definition white light endoscopy and electronic chromoendoscopy (NBI/FICE). The findings (detection of visible lesions/abnormal mucosal or vascular pattern) with electronic chromoendoscopy will be recorded. Biopsy specimens will be submitted for histopathologic examination and subsequently sent to the Cleveland Clinic for interpretation by a central GI pathologist who will be blinded to patient details and to reading by the WATS pathologist. The WATS procedure will be conducted using a standardized protocol as previously described.	Primary Objective(s): \nPrimary aim: In BE patients undergoing surveillance, to compare the diagnostic yield of low-grade dysplasia/high-grade dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma between the standard Seattle biopsy protocol (4-quadrant biopsy every 2 cm with target biopsies from any visible lesions) with sampling using WATS plus target biopsies from any visible lesion.\n\nSecondary Objective(s): \nSecondary aims: \n(i)\tTo compare the detection of intestinal metaplasia between these two strategies\n(ii)\tTo compare the 5-year progression rates to high-grade dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma between the two patient groups\n(iii)\tTo establish a tissue repository of WATS specimens with the goal of identifying biomarkers associated with risk of progression\n(iv)\tTo compare the time required to complete both procedures\n(v)\tTo conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis between the two strategies\n(vi)\tTo compare the number of patients referred for endoscopic eradication therapy (EET)	Primary Endpoint(s): \nThe primary endpoint will be detection of dysplasia between the two techniques (WATS vs. surveillance biopsies)	1	Inclusion criteria:\nPatients: \n1.\tBE length of at least M1\n2.\tNo prior history of dysplasia\n3.\tUndergoing surveillance endoscopy\nPhysicians:\nAll participating sites will include physicians who are trained in the use of WATS by the site PI and will need to complete a minimum of three cases to be eligible to participate in this study. \nExclusion criteria:\n1.\tBE patients undergoing surveillance or evaluation for EET for prior diagnosis of BE related neoplasia \n2.\tActive erosive esophagitis\n3.\tEsophageal varices\n4.\tCoagulopathy (INR >2, platelet count <50,000)\n5.\tPrior history of EET\n6.\tPrior history of esophageal or gastric surgery, except for uncomplicated fundoplication\n7.\tPregnancy	Proposed sites:\nProposed centers:\nUniversity of Colorado\nNorthwestern University\nUniversity of North Carolina\nUniversity of California Los Angeles\nWashington University in St Louis\nKaiser Permanente California\nGeisinger Medical Center	All patients will undergo standard upper endoscopy with biopsies using the Seattle biopsy protocol that is considered as the standard of care.\nIn addition all patients will undergo sampling using WATS (order of these sampling techniques will be randomized).\nWATS is a novel brush based technique that can sample large areas of the Barrett's segment. Analysis of the thick, highly cytologic, disaggregated tissue specimen that is obtained by the transepithelial sampling brush is aided by a neural network-based, high speed computer scan that examines the entire depth of field and highlights for pathology review potentially abnormal cells based on cellular morphology and molecular diagnostics.	2 years for primary endpoint	3-4 months for the primary endpoint	No conflicts of interest	The primary outcome comparing diagnostic yield of any dysplasia between the two methods will use McNemar's test for paired data and will exclude cases which were WATS positive but could not be confirmed by a concurrent (Seattle protocol) or follow-up biopsy. A sensitivity analysis will be completed which includes WATS positive cases which did not have diagnostic confirmation with biopsy. Comparison for the detection of intestinal metaplasia between the two strategies will use McNemar's test for paired data including all cases.	\N
78	2016-12-07	40	\N	\N	Optimal Use of Labor Induction Study	Labor Induction Study	4	Despite the fact that term childbirth is the most common reason for hospitalization in the USA today (approximately 3 million term births per year), and despite an increasing awareness of the importance 'personalized medicine' in many areas of health care (e.g., increased emphasis on human genomics), medical science has not attempted to carefully address questions related what constitutes the optimal time of delivery for any specific unique pregnancy.          The primary hypothesis of this study is that the concepts of personalized medicine can be applied to term pregnancy management. Specifically, the primary hypothesis of this study is that a method of term pregnancy management called the Active Management of Risk in Pregnancy at Term (AMOR-IPAT) will lead to improved childbirth outcomes, as compared to three more standard and less personalized approaches to term pregnancy management. It is essential to compare AMOR-IPAT to all three more standard approaches because a definitive understanding about the relative risks and benefits of AMOR-IPAT would not be obtained without these multiple comparisons. As an aside, this study will also provide data to enable the comparison of the three 'more standard approaches' with each other.             AMOR-IPAT uses known prenatal risks for cesarean delivery in every pregnancy to estimate a pregnancy-specific (i.e., 'unique') upper limit of the optimal time of delivery (UL-OTD) for every pregnancy. The UL-OTD is the gestational age above which the likelihood of cesarean delivery, and presumably risk of other adverse outcomes, begins to increase. If spontaneous labor has not started by the estimated UL-OTD, then induction of labor (hereinafter 'IOL') is offered so that labor and delivery are more likely to occur at an optimal time. AMOR-IPAT is only used during the term period of pregnancy. Term pregnancy for this study is defined as a pregnancy that has reached 37 weeks 0 days of gestation. Of note, most AMOR-IPAT IOL's are 'non-indicated.' An IOL is 'non-indicated' when one of a limited number of high risk factors, or 'indications' is not identified prior to the start of the induction.        The three alternative methods of care to be studied are:        The current standard of care (hereinafter 'CSOC'): CSOC emphasizes expectant management of term pregnancy and avoids IOL until 41 weeks 0 days if possible. Prior to 41 weeks 0 days, IOL is used only in response to the development of a 'high-risk state, or 'indication.'    Induction of all undelivered pregnancies at 39 weeks of gestation (hereinafter 'IOL-39').    Induction of all undelivered pregnancies at 40 weeks of gestation (hereinafter 'IOL-40').         The proposed study is large enough and complex enough to ask and answer several questions related to the optimal use of IOL in the term period of pregnancy. However, the primary hypothesis of this study is that AMOR-IPAT will provide superior childbirth outcomes compared to each of the other three more standard approaches.	This will be a four-arm RCT involving pregnancies of mixed parity (nulliparous and multiparous) with moderate levels of prenatal risk. The trial will involve 5 sites        The 5 sites will be:        Penn State Hershey/Harrisburg Hospital/York Hospital/Good Samaritan Hospital    Washington University    University of Oregon    UNC/Duke    University of Texas (Galveston)             The study will recruit women who are pregnant between 28 and 37 weeks of gestation who have a moderate level of risk as estimated by the AMOR-IPAT risk-scoring system. Specifically patients will be eligible to enroll in the study of their UL-OTD is less than 40 weeks 0 days. The study will seek to recruit 1500 nulliparous and 1500 multiparous pregnant women.        Women recruited into the study who remain pregnant at 36 weeks 6 days of gestation will be randomized equally to one of the three arms of the study.         Subject treatment based on study group:    1. Following randomization, subjects randomized to the AMOR-IPAT arm will be informed of their estimated UL-OTD and will be offered induction of labor date 1-3 days prior to their estimated UL-OTD.    2. Following randomization, subjects randomized to '39-week induction of labor' will be informed of their study group and will scheduled for a planned induction of labor no more than 3 days after reaching 39 weeks 0 days of gestation.    3. Following randomization, subjects randomized to '40-week induction of labor' will be informed of their study group and will scheduled for a planned induction of labor no more than 3 days after reaching 40 weeks 0 days of gestation.    4. Following randomization, subjects randomized to the current standard of care ('CSOC') will be informed of their study group and will scheduled for a planned induction of labor no more than 3 days after reaching 41 weeks 0 days of gestation.          All subjects will have a cervical examination in the 37th week of gestation to determine the need for cervical ripening prior to induction. Cervical ripening and labor induction will follow local standards for all study subjects, irrespective of study group assignment.          Clinical outcomes, and details of the course pre-delivery, delivery and post-partum care for mother and baby (including charges incurred for care), will be obtained for every pregnancy. The main study outcome will be the modified adverse outcome index score (mWAOI score). Secondary outcomes will include rates of uncomplicated delivery rate, cesarean delivery rate, and NICU admission, as well as neonatal respiratory status and overall all cost of care.	The primary aim of this study is to answer a basic obstetrical question: How do childbirth outcomes resulting from the exposure of term pregnancies with moderate levels of prenatal risk to AMOR-IPAT compare with childbirth outcomes resulting from exposure to the more standard strategies of term pregnancy management (i.e., CSOC, IOL-39, and IOL-40)?        The small AMOR-IPAT RCT reported relatively strong improvements in childbirth outcomes following the regular use of risk-based by 'non-indicated' IOL. Additional data on the relative risks and benefits of AMOR-IPAT are clearly needed. The primary endpoint will be the modified Weighted Adverse Outcome Index Score (mWAOI Score).                 The study will have four secondary aims:      1. To determine possible variations in the impact of exposure to AMOR-IPAT as a function of parity status (nulliparous vs. multiparous);    As noted above, nulliparous and multiparous pregnancy are different in clinically meaningful ways and the impact of AMOR-IPAT on both types of pregnancy needs to be studied. Outcome: mWAOI Score.      2. To determine possible variations in the impact of the regular use of AMOR-IPAT as a function of basic demographic variables (Caucasian vs. African American; Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic; private insurance vs. Medicaid);    Methods of term pregnancy care involving a variable use of IOL and that are guided by gestational age might have outcomes that differ depending on subject race, ethnicity or insurance status. Outcome: mWAOI Score.      3. To determine possible variations in childbirth outcomes between the three more accepted strategies of term pregnancy management;    There are no published RCT's that have compared CSOC to IOL-39 or IOL-40. Outcome: mWAOI Score.         4. To determine the relative cost of the four methods of care - as measured in medical charges.     If AMOR-IPAT leads to fewer post-partum complications, then a decrease in the cost of post-partum care might more than offset the increase cost of more frequent IOL. Outcome: charge data for care.	The primary endpoint of this study will be the modified Weighted Adverse Outcome Index Score (mWAOI Score). The mWAOI Score is based on the published and validated 10-item Weighted Adverse Outcome Index Score but has the addition of two other items: cesarean delivery, and complicated NICU admission.

The most important feature of an outcome like the mWAOI Score is that it provides a summary measure of the variety of adverse outcomes that can occur with delivery. In addition, the mWAOI score uses a weighting system wherein adverse outcomes that are more unfavorable are given more value than outcomes that - while unfavorable - are less so. Finally, the use of a composite outcome is advantageous because its structure increases the power of statistical comparisons between various groups and sub-groups within the study. The use of the mWAOI Score would increase the ability to determine whether or not there was an improvement in overall childbirth health following the use of any given care strategy.	3	Exclusion criteria for this study include:        Multiples (twins, triplets, etc.), 2) Ineligible for trial of labor (Prior cesarean delivery or transmural uterine incision, uterine anomaly, etc.), 3) Persistent malpresentation (breech or transverse), 4) HIV infection, 5) Age < 18 years, 6) Uncertain pregnancy dating, including lack of dating ultrasound prior to 20 weeks of gestation.        Thereafter, inclusion criteria will be based on the use of the published AMOR-IPAT risk scoring system.

Not provided.	AMOR-IPAT uses a risk scoring system to estimate, for every pregnancy, an upper limit of the optimal time of delivery (UL-OTD). The more risk a pregnancy has for cesarean delivery - and presumably other adverse birth outcomes - the lower the UL-OTD. Once an estimate of the UL-OTD for a given pregnancy is determined the patient is offered labor induction so that labor and delivery can be guaranteed to occur on or just before the pregnancy's UL-OTD. In reality, any given pregnancy might develop spontaneous labor prior to its UL-OTD and therefore labor induction would not be needed. However, groups of pregnancies exposed to AMOR-IPAT always have a higher rate of IOL than groups of pregnancies exposed to more usual strategies of term pregnancy management.         Inherent in the use of AMOR-IPAT is the regular use of cervical ripening agents prior to the onset of the labor induction. There are a variety of pharmacologic products and mechanical devices that have, over the past 20 years, significantly improved the safety and effectiveness of cervical ripening and labor induction. These agents will be used on a regular basis in all study groups when subjects are scheduled for labor induction but require cervical ripening.         Also inherent in the use of AMOR-IPAT is the regular use of risk-based but 'non-indicated' labor induction in the 38th week of gestation. The use of 'non-indicated' labor induction prior to 39 weeks of gestation is currently restricted throughout the USA because of concerns about neonatal morbidity related to 'early-term' delivery. However, those concerns are based primarily on observational studies that contain identifiable flaws. AMOR-IPAT recommends pre-39 week IOL only in pregnancies with fairly high levels of cumulative risk for cesarean delivery. In addition, the neonatal outcomes of pregnancies exposed to AMOR-IPAT that underwent risk-based IOL prior to 39 weeks were superior to the neonatal outcomes of CSOC pregnancies that were expectantly managed beyond 39 weeks 0 days of gestation. Hence, the part of AMOR-IPAT that involves pre-39 weeks risk-based but 'non-indicated' IOL appears to be both beneficial and safe.         For the IOL-39 study group, subjects will be scheduled for induction within 3 days of reaching 39 weeks 0 days of gestation         For the IOL-40 study group, subjects will be scheduled for induction within 3 days of reaching 40 weeks 0 days of gestation.         For the CSOC study group, subjects will be scheduled for induction within 3 days of reaching 41 weeks 0 days of gestation.	Not provided.	Not provided.

The statistical plan will initially include comparison of the basic make-up of all four study groups (and important sub-groups) as well as comparison of the clinical courses of subjects in the different areas of hospital care: clinical findings at the time of admission, mode of labor onset, details about cervical ripening and labor induction, and delivery information. Analysis will also include the comparison of data concerning the post-delivery course of mothers and baby in each group (and important sub-groups).  Due to concerns about pre-39 week delivery, a special emphasis will be placed on the measurement of neonatal outcomes in general and neonatal pulmonary health in particular.         The primary outcome for this study will be the mWAOI Score. Every pregnancy in the study will have its own mWAOI score. It is assumed that subjects in each study group will have a relatively continuous but non-parametric distribution of individual mWAOI scores within each group. The distribution of mWAOI Scores in each group will be compared with every other study group using non-parametric techniques. This will initially mean the use of simple Wilcoxon Rank-Sum testing followed by the use of stratified Wilcoxon testing to adjust for the presence of important covariates (i.e., parity status, race, ethnicity, insurance status).        The mWAOI Scores are predicted to have mean values significantly higher than WAOI scores because cesarean delivery is a relatively common adverse outcome and complicated NICU admission is a fairly common adverse outcome. A sample size of 143 per group will provide 80% power to detect a reduction of mWAOI Score from 12 to 6 between two treatment groups, assuming the standard deviation is 17.5 points, using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test having a significance level of 0.05. Such a reduction is expected for the comparison between AMOR-IPAT vs. CSOC. However, less treatment effect is predicted for the comparison between AMOR-IPAT and IOL-40, and even less for AMOR-IPAT vs. IOL-39. It is anticipated that a sample size of 250 per group will adequately power all comparisons.        Rates of dichotomous adverse outcomes will also be determined for each study group (and important sub-groups) and compared. Standard techniques using unadjusted comparison of rates will be used, followed by adjusted comparisons using logistic regression.        In addition, the study plans to collect qualitative data from both providers and patients about their satisfaction with the clinical course of each term pregnancy. These data will be collected through a series of short simple questionnaires.        Finally, the study will collect financial information as reflected in charges for term pre-hospital clinical activity and charges for maternal and neonatal care. Charge rather than payment data will be used to avoid the potential impact of variable insurance payment agreements. It is expected that the charges for each pregnancy within each group will be continuous and non-parametric in nature. Means, medians and standard distribution will be determined for each study group, but the groups (and important sub-groups [e.g., maternal care charges, neonatal care charges]) will be compared using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum testing methods.	Major problems with enrollment into this study are not anticipated. Problems with subject enrollment were not encountered during the AMOR-IPAT RCT performed at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006-2007, and the ongoing NICHD-MFMU 'ARRIVE' Trial is not encountering problems with subject enrollment. Enrollment will not be unusually difficult because it is common knowledge that many women develop a syndrome called 'tired of pregnancy' in the mid to late 3rd trimester. This means that the last month or two of pregnancy can be rather uncomfortable, and many women are interested in finding ways to deliver 'sooner rather than later'. Enrollment in this study would offer a relatively high chance of delivery at or prior to a pregnancy's due date, and that would be appealing to many pregnant women. An increasing amount of data is accumulating that suggests that delivery in the 39th week provides better outcomes than expectant management to a later gestational age. Hence, it appears that enrollment in this study will be both appreciated and relatively safe for mother and baby. Preliminary evidence suggests that exposure to AMOR-IPAT for patients with fairly high levels of cumulative prenatal risk for cesarean delivery - even with its recommendation for planned delivery prior to 39 weeks 0 days of gestation - might be safer than routine delivery in the 39th or 40th week.        It is assumed that this will be a 3-year study. Six months are budgeted for start-up and IRB approval activities. Two full years are budgeted for subject accrual, delivery and data collection. Six months are budgeted for final data collection, study close-out, data analysis and generation of manuscripts to report study findings.                               1st half                  2nd half                 1st half                 2nd half           1st half             2nd half  Site                           1st Year                  1st Year                 2nd Year              2nd Year          3rd Year           3rd Year                           Start-up                  70 enrolled           70 enrolled          70 enrolled     70 enrolled      Close-out  Site #1                            IRB                       50 delivered        50 delivered       50 delivered    50 delivered       Analysis                             Start-up                  70 enrolled           70 enrolled          70 enrolled     70 enrolled      Close-out  Site #2                             IRB                       50 delivered        50 delivered       50 delivered    50 delivered       Analysis                             Start-up                  70 enrolled           70 enrolled          70 enrolled     70 enrolled      Close-out  Site #3                                IRB                       50 delivered        50 delivered       50 delivered    50 delivered       Analysis                             Start-up                  70 enrolled           70 enrolled          70 enrolled     70 enrolled      Close-out  Site #4                             IRB                       50 delivered        50 delivered       50 delivered    50 delivered       Analysis                              Start-up                  70 enrolled           70 enrolled          70 enrolled     70 enrolled      Close-out  Site #5                               IRB                       50 delivered        50 delivered       50 delivered    50 delivered       Analysis                                                              350 enrolled       350 enrolled      350 enrolled     350 enrolled       1400 enrolled  TOTALS                                                          250 delivered     250 delivered     250 delivered   250 delivered     1000 delivered

310	2018-04-09	70	\N	\N	Operative versus Non-Operative Treatment for Atraumatic Rotator Cuff Tears: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Pragmatic Trial	ARC: Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Trial	4	We are conducting a randomized clinical trial of operative versus non-operative treatment of rotator cuff tears. We will compare pain and function in operative and non-operative groups at one (1) year follow-up. We will also study how age and rotator cuff tear size (on MRI) impacts of pain and functional outcomes. We hypothesize that patients undergoing operative treatment will have significantly greater improvement in pain and function compared to those treated non-operatively at 12 month follow-up. We predict that surgery will be more effective than non-operative treatment in cuff tears of increasing size, and in patients with decreasing age.	This is an unblinded, multi-center, pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial (phase 3) of operative versus non-operative treatments for atraumatic rotator cuff tears. A sample size of 700 patients will be enrolled with approximately equal numbers of patients randomized to operative treatment and non-operative treatment using computerized randomization. The purpose of surgery is to repair a torn rotator cuff whereas that of physical therapy is to strengthen and stretch the shoulder and peri-scapular muscles. At baseline, patients will fill out study questionnaires and undergo a brief physical examination. Follow-up will be performed via questionnaires at 3, 6, and 12 months.	Aim 1: To compare pain and function in patients undergoing operative versus non-operative treatment of atraumatic rotator cuff tears at 12 months of follow-up. \nAim 2: To assess effects of rotator cuff tear size and age on comparative outcomes (measured by SPADI) in operative versus non-operative treatments for atraumatic rotator cuff tears.	The primary outcome measure is SPADI, and the primary endpoint is the change in SPADI at 12 months relative to baseline. SPADI is measured on a scale of zero to 100, with lower scores for better outcomes. SPADI is a reliable and valid measure of shoulder function15-20. The secondary endpoint is ASES-SF13, cross-sectionally and longitudinally over time.	1	In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of\nthe following criteria:\n• Aged ≥50 years to <85 years\n• Shoulder pain and/or loss of active motion, strength or function\n• MRI-confirmed partial- or full-thickness supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus\ntear of 4cm or less in longitudinal dimension\n• Medically fit for surgery, defined as Category I-III per American Society of\nAnesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification (see Table 1: ASA Physical\nStatus Classifications and Examples)\nAny individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from\nparticipation in this study:\n• Primary diagnosis is something other than a rotator cuff tear\n• History (in last 2 years) of shoulder fracture involving the humeral head on\naffected side\n• Previous rotator cuff surgery on affected side\n• Isolated subscapularis &/or teres minor tear on affected side\n• Acute rotator cuff tear caused by a severe trauma (see TABLE 2: Trauma\nClassification)\n• Shoulder used as a weight-bearing joint\n• Contraindication to MRI (claustrophobia, pacemaker, pregnancy, shoulder\nimplant, etc.)\n• Glenohumeral osteoarthritis on xrays/MRI\n• Grade 4 fatty infiltration of rotator cuff (any tendons)\n• Candidate for reverse shoulder arthroplasty or total shoulder arthroplasty at\nBaseline	A total of 12 sites (including Vanderbilt) plan to participate in study recruitment at this time.	Patients will be randomly assigned to either operative (surgical) or non-operative (physical therapy) treatment of their rotator cuff tear.  These are both standard of care treatments for rotator cuff injuries. \n\nOperative treatment will include an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery. As in usual clinical practice, patients will have post-operative physical therapy after surgery. The post-operative physical therapy lasts for approximately 4 months. A standardized post-operative physical therapy regimen for this trial is included in Supplemental Materials.\n\nPatients randomized to non-operative treatment will only receive physical therapy. This usually lasts for approximately 3 months.	The primary study is expected to last approximately 60 months.	For the primary study, each participant is expected to complete all procedures and questionnaires within approximately one year.  For the sub study, participants may continue to complete questionnaires annually for up to ten years after enrollment and return for a single research MRI between 2 and 7 years after initial enrollment.

This study is a prospective, case control study designed to assess the ability of autonomic testing to identify individuals who following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI = concussion) are at risk for a prolonged post-concussive syndrome (PCS). This will be followed by a randomized intervention study to identify the efficacy of a graded exercise program (vs. passive stretching) on accelerating the normalization of function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), as well as resolution of PCS symptoms following mTBI.	Primary Objective: \nTo prove that baseline autonomic testing can identify individuals who have been concussed, and are symptomatic, who are at increased risk for a protracted post-concussive syndrome (PCS). \n\nSecondary Objectives:\n1. To prove that graded exercise therapy can accelerate the resolution of PCS symptoms following mTBI. \n2. To prove that graded exercise therapy accelerates the resolution of PCS symptoms following mTBI more effectively in concussed individuals who are symptomatic with baseline exercise testing.\n3. To prove that the normalization of function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), as reflected by improvement of beat to beat heart rate variability (r-r HRV) is a biomarker for the two secondary objectives identified above.	Primary (Observational) Study:\nConcussed subjects and controls will undergo a baseline testing session that includes autonomic testing with a "cold glove", as well as exercise testing on a stationary bicycle.\n\nSecondary (Interventional) Study:\nIndividuals with concussion will then be divided into groups based on whether their PCS symptoms are inducible during baseline exercise testing. Both concussed subjects who experience symptom worsening during baseline exercising, as well as those who don't, will be randomized into two longitudinal testing groups: one engaging in a regular at-home graded exercise regimen for up to twelve weeks, the other engaging in (non-intensive) passive stretching over the same time course.\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the intervention is to identify whether graded exercise (vs. passive stretching) can accelerate symptomatic recovery following concussion and if so, whether that improvement is accentuated in concussed individuals who had augmented symptoms during baseline exercise testing.\n\nThe strategy for assigning interventions to participants is to randomize the active therapeutic intervention (vs. passive stretching) evenly across the two study groups: concussed individuals who have augmented symptoms during baseline exercise testing, and those who do not.\n\nThe number of arms = 4:\n1. Concussed subjects whose post-concussive symptoms are worsened with baseline exercise testing, who are randomized to graded exercise;\n2. Concussed subjects whose post-concussive symptoms are worsened with baseline exercise testing, who are randomized to passive stretching;\n3. Concussed subjects whose post-concussive symptoms are not worsened with baseline exercise testing, who are randomized to graded exercise;\n4. Concussed subjects whose post-concussive symptoms are not worsened with baseline exercise testing, who are randomized to passive stretching;\n\nNo one will be masked/blinded.	3	Inclusion (Controls):\n1. 14-45 years old;\n2.

Approximately 5-6 sites, all within the US, all at Institutions with funded CTSC programs. Sites have been selected based on having ongoing concussion research programs, including current IRB approval for those studies, with active recruitment of individuals 14-45 (i.e., including adolescent, as well as adult concussion research programs) at present.	The novel medical device to be used and validated is called a "cold glove", which we have designed, and are in the process of manufacturing. The device, for which Cornell has filed a patent, enables an easy to use version of the cold pressor test, which was developed in the 1980's to diagnose individuals with autonomic dysfunction. The cold pressor test measures the response of a patient's autonomic nervous system (i.e., blood pressure and heart rate) to cold temperature applied to the hand. In this study we will be using the cold glove to perform the cold pressor test.  The cold glove consists of an enclosed, temperature-controlled metal plate, to apply cold temperature to the hand. Total testing will take ~10 minutes to complete and will involve the participant reclining on an examination table for 5 minutes, placing their hand in the temperature controlled glove for 2 minutes, and removing the hand while lying down for an additional 3 minutes. The temperature of the glove will be ~ 0 degrees Celsius, and the participant will be asked to keep their hand in the glove for a maximum time of 2 minutes, as tolerated.	2 years.	A maximum of 12 weeks. There will be only 1 study visit for control subjects. Concussed individuals will participate remotely for up to a maximum of 12 weeks.	I am the Founder and President of ANSwers Neuroscience, a company that is trying to collect sufficient data from this clinical study to get FDA approval for the cold glove as a Class II medical device to diagnose autonomic dysfunction.	\N	\N
108	2017-02-08	70	\N	\N	Study of Anti-Malarials in Incomplete Lupus - SMILE	SMILE Study	\N	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that causes major organ damage and shortens lifespan.  It has a disproportionate impact on young people, especially women. Despite advances in treatment, morbidity and mortality in this largely young population are unacceptably high.  This is in part due to the fact that many patients present at a stage when organ damage is already present.  A key to improving outcomes in any chronic disease is early identification and treatment, prior to the onset of irreversible changes.   A major challenge to this approach in SLE has been a lack of biomarkers that confidently identify individuals in early disease stages.  Identification of an at-risk population would not be especially useful without an available therapeutic approach. That is, one that would offer potential for disease modification while at the same time presenting an acceptable safety profile.   An available medication that fits this description is hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).  Data from a retrospective analysis of patients who had symptoms suggestive of lupus but who did not fit classification criteria for SLE demonstrated that HCQ could delay full disease onset.  Other limited observational studies suggest that autoantibody profiles can be modified by HCQ treatment.  Although HCQ is used commonly in clinical practice where it is thought to improve outcomes of ILE patients, no controlled trial data are available to document the clinical, immunologic and adverse effects of HCQ in a population at risk for SLE.           The primary objective of the 'Study of Anti-Malarials in Incomplete Lupus Erythematosus - SMILE' is to determine the ability of HCQ treatment of ILE patients to prevent acquisition of additional clinical and immunologic features that define SLE.  The major secondary objectives are to determine whether HCQ treatment: (1) lessens lupus disease activity as measured by standard scoring indices; (2) improves patient reported outcomes (3) prevents accumulation of immunologic abnormalities including autoantibodies and cytokines and (4) has an acceptable toxicity profile.          The SMILE trial will determine whether or not HCQ should be given to ILE patients, will provide insights into the appropriate target population, and will propose candidate biomarkers to guide treatment decisions.  While not part of the Precision Medicine Initiative?, SMILE is consistent with its goals.  It will be the first step towards testing the feasibility of disease prevention studies in SLE and will accumulate biological samples in a repository that will be available to the lupus research community for further in-depth mechanistic studies.	This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  The trial plans to enroll 240 subjects.  Each subject will receive study drug, either hydroxychloroquine or placebo, daily for 96 weeks.  Subjects will be randomized by study site and number of existing lupus criteria that they satisfy.  Clinical and laboratory evaluations will take place every three months.     Screening data including history, physical, and laboratory analyses will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility.  Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.          The following treatment regimens will be used:           Hydroxychloroquine sulfate at 400 mg/day for subjects weighing 40 kilograms or more, and 200 mg/day for subjects weighing less than 40 kilograms.           Matching placebo - two capsules daily for subjects weighing 40 kilograms or more and one capsule/day for subjects weighing less than 40 kilograms.           Total duration of subject participation will be 104 weeks.  Subjects who meet a total of four or more SLICC classification criteria for SLE during the study will stop their participation (see section 8.6) Total duration of the study is expected to be 48 months.          The screening visit is Visit 1.  Randomization will occur at Visit 3, which will occur 4 weeks ? 3 days after Visit 1.  Visits 4-11 will occur at twelve-week intervals ? 7 days.          At approximately one-month intervals, study personnel will call each subject to reinforce compliance with study procedures.  Any potential adverse events or significant changes in the subject's medical condition will prompt an unscheduled study visit.          Unscheduled visits may be performed to document adverse events, worsening of the subject's medical condition, or withdrawal from the study.  Assessments for Unscheduled Visits are given in Section 10 and the Appendix.          Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled at study Visit 1.  Prior to that time, the participants will have had a copy of the informed consent document to review and will have had an opportunity to ask questions of the study team.  Informed Consent and Authorization for Disclosure under HIPAA will be documented before any study procedures take place.          Participants will be randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine or matching placebo at Visit 3 (week 4) using a centralized system that is stratified by treatment site and number of baseline SLICC classification criteria.  That is, ANA plus one criterion, or ANA plus two criteria.          Participants and the clinical study staff will be blinded as to which treatment is administered.  Study pharmacists at each site (if required) will also be blinded. Other personnel (study monitors, statisticians, NIAMS project officers, etc.) will remain blinded to study treatment until all subjects have completed the trial and the database is locked.          Every effort will be undertaken to maintain the blinding of study treatment.  In the event that a participant has a medical emergency the site principal investigator may break the blind.  This should be done only if it will affect the participant's immediate medical care and should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and Sponsor.  Information for un-blinding will be kept in a printed document that will be stored locked in a secure office safe in the Department of Health Sciences at Hershey and will be used by the PI with permission from the Sponsor.         Prior to conducting any study-related activities, written informed consent and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be signed and dated by the subject or subject's legal representative.  If appropriate, assent of minor participants must also be obtained prior to conducting any study-related activities.        All concomitant medication and concurrent therapies will be documented at Visit 1 (screening) and all subsequent visits.  Dose, route, frequency of administration, and indication for administration and dates of medication will be captured.         Demographic information (date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity) will be recorded at Visit 1.         Relevant medical history, including features of incomplete lupus erythematosus, and other pertinent medical conditions, and their treatment will be recorded at Visit 1.  A history of autoimmune disease in the participant's biological parents, biological siblings, and biological children will be elicited and recorded without direct identifiers.         Either the investigator or a sub-investigator who is a physician at Visits 1 and 3-11 will perform a complete physical examination.  New abnormal physical exam findings must be documented and will be followed by a physician or other qualified staff at the next scheduled visit.     Body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse will be performed after resting for 5 minutes at all visits.        At Visit 2, and again at Visit 12, participants will undergo ophthalmological examination including:       1.              Dilated fundoscopic examination (DFE)       2.              Spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT)       3.              Humphrey visual field (HVF) testing using a 10-2 pattern         At each visit, the presence or absence of clinical classification criteria for SLE set forth by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) (see Appendix) will be determined and recorded.         At each visit, the presence or absence of clinical classification criteria for SLE set forth by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (see Appendix) will be determined and recorded.         At each visit, the Modified SLEDAI-2K disease activity instrument for SLE will be determined and recorded.  The Modified SLEDAI-2K is identical to the original SLEDAI-2K, but includes the provider's global assessment (PGA) and SLE Flare Index incorporated into the document.  The period of assessment is the 30 days prior the visit as this has been effective in longitudinal studies35.         At each visit, the Cutaneous Lupus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) will be determined and recorded         At Visit 3 (Baseline), Visit 7 (Week 52) and Visit 11 (Week 100), the SLICC/ACR Damage Index will be determined and recorded.         At each visit, patient reported outcomes instruments will be administered and recorded.  These include the PROMIS 29 Adult or Pediatric Profile supplemented with additional questions from the PROMIS Fatigue item bank, and a Patient Global Visual Analogue Scale.         At Visit 1 (Screening) the CSQ will be administered and recorded.         Information regarding occurrence of adverse events will be captured throughout the study. Duration (start and stop dates), severity/grade, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug will be recorded on the case report form (CRF).         The following tests (9.3 - 9.4.6) will be performed as outlined in Section 10 and the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1)         Blood will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical hematology lab for a complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, white blood cell differential, and platelet count), and direct anti-globulin (Coombs) test.    Blood will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical chemistry lab for determination of serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, random glucose, BUN, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, calcium, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.         Blood will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical lab for determination of the blood level of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.         Blood will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical chemistry lab for determination of the serum concentration of 25-OH-vitamin D.         A urine pregnancy test will be obtained from female subjects who are of childbearing age prior to their participation in the study and at week 52.         Urine will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical laboratory for determination of color, specific gravity, pH, protein (qualitative and quantitative), glucose, ketones, blood and creatinine (quantitative).  Microscopic analysis will be performed to determine the presence of casts and cellular elements.         Blood will be obtained and sent to each site's clinical chemistry lab for determination of complement 3 (C3) and complement 4 (C4) concentrations.         Blood will be obtained and sent to a central laboratory for determination of anti-nuclear antibodies by immunofluorescence, anti-CCP 3.1, antibodies to double-stranded DNA, Ro60, Ro52, La, Sm, U1-RNP, Jo-1, centromere, histones, cardiolipin, and beta-2-glycoprotein I.         Blood will be obtained and sent to a central lab for determination of serum/plasma IgG, IgM, and IgA autoantibodies to a panel of ~100 auto-antigens using microarray methodology.         Serum levels of specific antibodies will be compared between baseline and different time points.  Levels of antibodies will be compared to the presence of clinical features of SLE.  The presence and concentration of antibodies will be correlated with treatment.         Blood will be obtained and sent to a central lab for determination of serum/plasma concentrations of ~30 cytokines and inflammatory mediators using multiplex bead technology.	1.To carry out a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized trial of HCQ vs. placebo in patients with ILE.  The study tests the hypothesis that early use of HCQ can modify disease features so that accumulation of abnormalities leading to a classification of SLE can be significantly slowed.           The primary endpoint is the increase in clinical and laboratory disease features of SLE defined by the 2012 SLICC classification criteria between month 0 and month 24 .         2. To determine effects of HCQ on disease activity and patient-reported outcomes in patients with ILE. The outcome is the change in score for the PROMIS 29 Adult Profile supplemented with additional fatigue questions from the PROMIS item bank along with a Visual Analog Scale.           3. To characterize the immunologic profile of HCQ in ILE-treated patients.   Autoantibodies, cytokines and chemokines will be measured on multiplex arrays to develop insights into underlying mechanisms.The outcome is the change in autoantibodies determined by a 125 antigen microarray, and soluble mediators determined by solid phase immunoassay.          4.To quantitatively assess the incidence of ophthalmologic toxicity in HCQ-treated ILE patients.  All enrolled patients will have standardized ophthalmologic examinations before and after study treatment.  Recommendations for use and monitoring in this patient population will be developed.    Using a standardized reporting template, changes in dilated fundoscopic exam, spectral domain ocular coherence tomography, and Humphrey Visual Field testing will be qualified before and after exposure to hydroxychloroquine or placebo.

Not provided	Total duration of subject participation will be 104 weeks.  Subjects who meet a total of four or more SLICC classification criteria for SLE during the study will stop their participation (see section 8.6) Total duration of the study is expected to be 48 months.	\N	Randomization or participants will be stratified according to clinical site and number of SLICC criteria at baseline.  That is, ANA plus one additional criterion (two total) or ANA plus two additional criteria (three total).  The primary outcome variable in this double blind, randomized trial is the SLICC classification criteria count, measured every 12 weeks months over a 96-week period. Patients are eligible for the trial if they exhibit a SLICC classification criteria count of 2 or 3 at the baseline visit. Ordinal logistic regression analysis with random effects will be applied to compare the estimated slopes for the HCQ and placebo groups with respect to the SLICC classification criteria count over the 96-week follow-up period. The primary null hypothesis is that the HCQ slope equals the placebo slope, and its corresponding alternative hypothesis is that the HCQ slope does not equal the placebo slope. Thus, a two-sided test with a 0.05 significance level will be applied. The statistical model will account for the ordinal and non-decreasing properties of the SLICC classification criteria count during the 96-week follow-up period, as well as account for the repeated measurements on each patient. This statistical model will form the basis of the primary statistical analysis of the SLICC classification criteria count, as well as all secondary and subgroup analyses with the SLICC classification criteria count.          A maximum likelihood (ML) estimation will be applied for estimating all of the model parameters, namely, the intercepts, the fixed-effects parameter vector, and the variance-covariance matrix for the random effects, and apply likelihood ratio (LR) tests for testing hypotheses. Finally, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted by constructing a cell means model (a mean parameter for each time point and each treatment group, instead of a slope model) and comparing the 96-week change between the HCQ and placebo groups.          The ML estimation and LR tests are valid under a missing-at-random (MAR) mechanism. If there is reason to suspect non-ignorable missing data mechanism, then the statistical model will be expanded to be a joint model that includes (1) the ordinal logistic regression model of the SLICC repeated measurements, (2) a hazards regression model for the time-to-withdrawal, and (3) shared fixed-effects and random-effects parameters between the two models.The target sample size for this trial is 240 patients (120 randomized to each of the placebo and HCQ groups), which was calculated in the following manner. For the primary outcome variable of the SLICC classification criteria count, it is anticipated that the probability of the SLICC score progressing at least one stage during the 96-week follow-up period is 0.4 for a placebo patient, based on a composite of the pilot data and the report by Wieczorek et al. The assumption is that HCQ will be deemed clinically effective if it can reduce this probability of progression to 0.2. The sample size must be large enough such that a two-sided, 0.05 significance level test, based on the statistical analysis for the primary outcome described above, can detect this clinically meaningful effect with 90% statistical power while accounting for a 25% loss to follow-up. Because the planned statistical analysis for the primary outcome variable is rather complex, a closed-form expression for the sample size calculation is not possible. Therefore, a computer study was performed with 1,000 simulated data sets such that, on the average, one-half of the placebo patients and one-fourth of the HCQ patients progressed at least one stage with respect to the SLIC score over a 96-week period. The null hypothesis of equal placebo and HCQ slopes was rejected in 901 of the 1,000 simulated data sets (90.1% statistical power) when the sample size was 240 subjects with a 25% withdrawal rate per data set.	The recruitment plan will be approved by the IRB at each site or by the central IRB, as appropriate.  The protocol recruitment and retention officer is Dr. Mariko Ishimori.  The target population for this study is males or females with incomplete lupus in the age range 15 to 45 years, inclusive.  Since current or past treatment with hydroxychloroquine is not permitted, most recruitment efforts will be focused on new patient referrals at each site.  Each site will be encouraged to develop approaches to identify these patients such as through triage systems for new consultation requests, local advertising, contact with local support groups as well as through social media.  With IRB approval, electronic medical records also may be used to screen potential subjects who are scheduled for the rheumatology clinics at each institution.           Each site will generate and maintain a list of candidate patients based on referral and chart information.  Rheumatology clinicians at each site will be made aware of the study and the recruitment efforts.  Patients may be given a 'permission to notify' letter by their personal rheumatologist, which will allow study staff to contact the individual after a clinic visit by telephone.  The study coordinator may then contact this person by phone and use an IRB-approved script to describe the study to the patient.  If the patient wishes to receive more information, then a consent form may be mailed to their home.   If the patient wishes to make an appointment for screening, the coordinator will be ready with a calendar of available dates to accommodate that request.            Written informed consent is obtained by the site investigator or study coordinator at each site.  No study-related events will take place until signed informed consent has been obtained.          Retention of study subjects in a 24-month trial is critical to study success.  The study is designed to have a statistically significant outcome with at least 75% retention.  The importance of follow-up and completion will be emphasized to the patient at the time of consent.   Study candidates in whom other events that might interfere with participation are planned, such as surgeries, relocations or travel, will be encouraged to consider enrollment only after these take place.  Study coordinators will collect more than one contact phone number (i.e. home, work, mobile) when available, and will also request contact information for another person such as a parent as a backup in the event of communications interruptions.  Investigators and coordinators will be encouraged to be alert to any logistic problems such as parking or unexpected travel expense that might be remediable in order to retain a patient in the study.  Study coordinators will contact each enrolled patient once by phone approximately midway between the 3-month scheduled follow-up visits to review any new issues and to remind the patient about study compliance.  Recruitment and retention status reports will be prepared and presented to the Executive Committee by Dr. Ishimori as part of the regular monthly phone conference.
429	2018-11-23	5	\N	t	Consultative Service for a VA Cooperative Studies Program clinical trial, Double-blind Placebo-Controlled Study of Lithium for Preventing Repeated Suicidal Self-Directed Violence in Patients with Depression or Bipolar Disorder (CSP #590)	Consultative Service for a VA Cooperative Studies Program clinical trial	4	The question about the effectiveness of lithium for suicide prevention is one of major scientific, clinical, and public health significance. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), as the largest national healthcare system with an established program for identifying new suicide attempts, evaluating patients for underlying mental health and medical conditions, providing needed services, connecting Veterans to state-of-the-art suicide risk management, and monitoring outcomes is uniquely able to conduct a large scale clinical trial of lithium for suicide prevention. The VHA aims to test the hypothesis that lithium augmentation of enhanced usual care will reduce the rate of repeated episodes of suicidal self-directed violence (repeated suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations specifically to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide) in participants with bipolar disorder or depression who have survived a recent self-directed violence event.	Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of lithium versus placebo augmentation of enhanced usual care.\nPrimary outcome: Time to the first repeated episode of suicidal self-directed violence, including suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations specifically to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide\nDuration: Total study duration will be 4.5 years. Recruitment will occur over 3 years. Participants will be followed for one year.\nRandomization Plan: Both stratification and blocking will be utilized to control for potential imbalances in randomization. The randomization scheme will be stratified by participating site in addition to diagnosis (bipolar vs. depression) and history of prior attempts other than the index attempt (none vs. 1+ attempt). Stratification by site is necessary because of possible regional differences in clinical practices. Participants will be randomized to either lithium or placebo within permuted random blocks of 4 so that the treatment arms are balanced after every 4th randomization within the 4 strata at each site: bipolar with prior attempt, bipolar without prior attempt, depression with prior attempt, and depression without prior attempt. Breaking the blind at the end of each participant's time in the study is not expected to provide information about the treatment assignment of participants remaining in the study as block randomization is within multiple strata. Regardless, an extra treatment assignment will be inserted to each stratum of four to disrupt the blocks and make block size harder to discern.	The primary hypothesis is that lithium is superior to placebo for the prevention of episodes of suicidal self-directed violence over time. The primary outcome measure is time from randomization for treatment allocation to the first episode, either a suicide attempt, an interrupted attempt, a hospitalization specifically to prevent suicide, or death from suicide.\nAs secondary objectives of the study, the efficacy of lithium will be evaluated for the prevention of subtypes of suicidal self-directed violence, for all suicidal self-directed violence events (even after the first recurrence), for the prevention of repeated events in subgroups as well as the entire sample, and to identify potential mediators.\nThe tertiary objective of the study is to extend the follow up period using electronically available data to describe patterns of lithium use following active participation in the study participants, as well as to evaluate rates and determinants of suicide reattempts and all cause mortality over a longer follow up period.\nThe study will enroll and randomize 1,862 patients to receive either lithium or placebo with enhanced usual care. The study is projected to run a total of 4.5 years with 3 years of recruitment, 1 year of follow-up on lithium or placebo, and time for start-up and closeout as indicated in the study budget. We expect to enroll, on average, 65 patients per site at 29 VA medical centers.	The primary outcome will be time to the first repeated episode of suicidal self directed violence including (non-fatal) suicide attempts and deaths from suicide over the one year follow-up period. Interrupted attempts and hospitalizations specifically for the prevention of suicide will be considered equivalent to attempts. To minimize variability and bias in identifying episodes of suicidal self-directed violence, the Outcomes Adjudication Committee will review all potential outcome events, and make final determinations about which should be considered.\nThe nomenclature and definitions for suicide-related behaviors will follow CDC definitions (Crosby et al., 2011). By definition, an attempt must be accompanied by a wish to die, either reported by the patient, or inferred on the basis of his or her behavior. Repeated suicide attempts are clinically significant outcomes and a proxy for death from suicide.\nThe study will utilize all available sources of information about repeated suicide attempts including the medical record and VA-Suicide Prevention and Application Network (SPAN) data. As proposed in the draft FDA guidelines for clinical trials in suicide (FDA Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Draft Guidance, 2012), the study will utilize the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS; Posner et al., 2011) , supplemented with additional information about preparatory behavior, interrupted attempts, and other forms of self-directed violence (e.g., whether the events was a suicide attempt, an event of undetermined intent, or non-suicidal self-directed violence) to align the CSSRS with the recently adopted CDC classification system (Crosby et al., 2011). The need for additional information to allow cross-walking between the Columbia and CDC approaches has been documented by the Matarazzo et al. (2013).\nFor reports of suicide attempts, self-report data from the CSSRS will be supplemented with information from the Suicide Intent Scale (Beck et al., 1974) to allow further characterization of attempts, and to distinguish impulsive from non-impulsive attempts (Spokas et al., 2012). For these analyses, attempts will be considered to be impulsive when the patient reports no premeditation on the Suicide Intent Scale.\nIn addition to repeated episodes of suicidal self-directed violence, the study will obtain data on a number of secondary outcomes within the 12 month follow up period. These will go beyond the time to the first outcome event to include the total numbers of suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations for the prevention of suicide, emergency department visits, non-suicidal self-directed violent behaviors, and deaths from suicide, unnatural deaths, and all-causes. To support exploratory analyses on subtypes of suicide attempts, the study will obtain data on impulsive and non-impulsive attempts.\nFollowing the total number of suicide attempts and time to the first attempt will allow comparison of our findings with other studies that used rates of attempts as an outcome. Following the impact of the study treatment on other forms of self-directed violence will allow us to explore the specificity of the observed treatment effects. The proposal to evaluate treatment effects on all unnatural deaths and on all-cause mortality follows from concerns that deaths from other causes in patients who have survived suicide attempts may represent suicide-equivalents or cases misclassified by medical examiners or coroners. However, we recognize that the observed rates of all-cause of mortality in persons who have attempted suicide are lower than reattempt rates, and, therefore, the study would not be powered to detect a treatment effect on overall mortality. Finally, exploratory analyses on impulsive versus non-impulsive attempts, defined on the basis of reports of the absence or presence of premeditation on the Suicide Intent Scale, may provide further insights into whether any observed effects of lithium could be related to a decrease in impulsive behaviors.	1	Inclusion Criteria\nAdmission of patients to CSP590 will require that:\n1.

Enrollment and active participation in another randomized interventional clinical trial	For evaluating the feasibility of successfully completing CSP590, we used the VA-SPAN data to identify veterans within the VHA with bipolar or depressive disorder, who survived a suicide attempt during the 24 month period from the second half of fiscal year 2010 to the first half of fiscal year 2012. The flow chart in Section XXI (Figure 1) describes the process by which we determined the eligible cohort.\nDuring this 24 month period, 28,934 veterans survived an attempted suicide and of this cohort, 17,656 subjects (65%) were potentially eligible for CSP590. Table 4 gives the 50 VA sites with the largest number of potentially eligible subjects for a one year period.\nAssuming we are able to recruit approximately 1 out of 5 eligible subjects, full enrollment would require evaluating a total of 9310 potential subjects. Estimates of the number of study sites required to achieve this target are given in Table 4. Assuming participation of all sites with high numbers of potentially eligible subjects, the minimum number of sites that would be required is 21. A more conservative estimate used the actual sites that agreed to participate and the estimate that 20% of potentially eligible subjects would be recruited. Based on these calculations, we are proposing to include 29 sites.\nAlso in support of the feasibility of our protocol which calls for titration and blood collection, we have data (not shown) that approximately 70% of those who survive suicide attempts live within 60 miles of a VA medical center.\nWhen identifying the 29 VA sites, we will utilize the CSP Network of Dedicated Enrollment Sites (NODES) whenever possible. As a consortium of VA medical centers dedicated to the multi-site clinical research mission of CSP, it represents sites that should be well-equipped to conduct this study. Eight of the NODES sites (San Diego, Houston, Minneapolis, Dallas, Hines, Palo Alto, Salt Lake City, and Portland) are in the 50 top sites for potentially eligible subjects for this proposed study. Together, they would contribute approximately 2707 potentially eligible subjects over three years, or almost 30% of the total required.\nSite Selection\nTo assist with site selection for CSP590, a survey was conducted on a total of 70 sites comprised of the top 50 sites identified in Table 4, 3 additional CSP NODE sites that were not in the top 50 list, and 17 sites which independently expressed interest. From the 40 sites that returned the survey, the top 29 with the largest pool of potentially eligible subjects have been identified. In addition, 2 VISN1 Clinical Research sites have been added to maintain the enrollment estimate needed for CSP590, but will be included in the Boston site.\nTable 4 (sites): Orlando; Northern Calif;  San Diego; Montana; Atlanta; Central Texas; Las Vegas; Baltimore, includes Perry Point; Marion, Illinois; Edward Hines VAMC; West Palm Beach; Palo Alto; Denver; Central Arkansas; Milwaukee; Salt Lake City; Central Alabama; Muskogee; Puget Sound HCS; Philadelphia; Madison; Roseburg; Washington DC; Marion, IN; St Louis; Columbia, SC; Tampa; Pittsburgh; Houston; Reno; Gainesville; Tenn. Valley; Phoenix; Portland; Minneapolis; Jesse Brown VAMC; West Texas; Amarillo; New Jersey; Dallas; Tomah; Tucson; Battle Creek; Indianapolis; Bay Pines; Dublin; Poplar Bluff; Biloxi; Loma Linda	Lithium will be provided as extended-release lithium carbonate (or placebo) in 300 mg tablets. Subjects will be started on 600 mg/day (300 mg bid), unless there are clinical indications for starting at a lower dose (300 mg/day). Lithium (or placebo) plasma levels will be determined (by send-out central lab testing) after each dose adjustment (see section XIV, Titration Visits, for more detail) until steady state at target plasma levels between 0.6 and 0.8 mEq/L is achieved. Steady state is defined as a serum lithium level between 0.6 and 0.8 mEq/L, over 2 consecutive visits, at the same dose, and with the second level the same or 0.1 mEq/L lower than the first level. The target range will be operationalized by providing guidance to Site Physicians that they should stop titrating the dose upwards if proportional increases in plasma levels would exceed 0.8 mEq/L, that is, if the steady state plasma level on a dose of 300 mg/day exceeds 0.40 mEq/L or the level of a dose of 600mg/day exceeds 0.53 mEq/L. After steady state levels within the target range are achieved, the frequency of plasma level determinations will be decreased to monthly until the end of six month's participation, and then quarterly unless they are on an ACE inhibitor or a diuretic, in which case monthly monitoring will continue; they will be done more frequently when medically indicated in either the lithium or the placebo group.	Total study duration will be 4.5 years. Recruitment will occur over 3 years. Participants will be followed for one year.\nStart date: July 8, 2015\nEstimated completion date: August 2019.	12	None.	Overview\nThe primary hypothesis is that lithium is superior to placebo for the prevention of episodes of suicidal self-directed violence, including suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide over the ensuing year. The primary outcome measure is time from randomization for treatment allocation to the first episode. The results for event-free survival will be analyzed by means of a two-sided log-rank test. The study will have one interim analysis and one final analysis.\nThe duration of the study will be 4.5 years total, which allows for 3 years of recruitment, 1 year of follow-up for all enrollees, and time for start-up and closeout as indicated. A total of 1,862 patients will be enrolled and randomized to receive either lithium or placebo, both in addition to enhanced usual care.	Recruitment: Case identification and recruitment will proceed through the following steps, generally in two or three visits:\n1. Veterans who have survived suicide attempts may come to the attention of the Suicide Prevention Coordinators from providers, SPAN, or the Veterans Crisis Line. SPCs will refer the patient to the Research Team at the site.\n2. Site Coordinators may also become aware of potential participants through outreach such as scanning admissions and ER logs for events, and IRB approved posters and pamphlets advertising the study.\n3. During pre-screening, the research team will review the medical record for information about the recent episodes, diagnoses, and medications.\n4. Before contacting a patient directly, the site coordinator must ensure that a member of the patient's mental health care team has introduced the study to the patient and the patient agrees to be contacted by the study team. The method used by the provider to document the permission of the participant to be contacted can be done in the following ways: 1) the provider can document via an encrypted email or 2) a non-VA Mental Health provider can send to a secure faxline or by US mail to study site with permission granted by patient to have the study team contact the potential pariticpant.\nShould a potential participant contact the research team directly to learn more about the research study, a research team member can speak with the potential participant about the study.\n5. When a patient appears eligible, consent will be sought.

421	2018-11-20	5	\N	t	NU 15B06: A large-scale multicenter phase II study evaluating the protective effect of a tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC) in women with newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma in situ.	The Promise Study	3	This is a phase II multicenter randomized, double blind, placebo controlled pre-surgical\n"Window of opportunity" trial of CE/BZA vs. placebo daily for 28 ± 7 days in postmenopausal\nwomen diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by core needle biopsy (CNB) and\nundergoing surgical resection for DCIS. We plan to enroll 160 patients and expect a ~20%\nattrition rate due to lack of available tissue at the time of surgical resection, patient drop out,\nand scheduling conflicts that arise after enrollment. The interval of time from diagnosis to\nsurgery is on average 4-6 weeks depending on surgical scheduling, type of surgery and the\naddition of immediate breast reconstruction. Women will be recruited from the Lynn Sage\nBreast Center (Northwestern University) and participating sites. Postmenopausal women who\nmeet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to the CE/BZA arm or placebo arm. The primary\nendpoint is DCIS epithelial proliferation as measured by the change in Ki-67 labeling index\nbetween the baseline core biopsy and the surgical specimen after an intervention with CE/BZA\nor placebo. The secondary endpoints include: 1) expression of ERα, PR, and HER-2; 2)\nexpression of estrogen modulated genes; 3) ARG2 expression 4) expression of the ARCS\nsignature; 5) expression of stromal markers indicative of a pro-tumorigenic multicellular\nstromal program; 6) expression of markers reflecting acquisition of pro-tumorigenic\nmacrophage and immunosuppressive T cell phenotypes; 7) quality of life (QOL) and 7)\nCE/BZA metabolism as measured by CE/BZA pharmacokinetics and coagulation variables in\nrelationship to UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms.	The typical four to six week interval between diagnosis (needle core biopsy) and\nsurgery can be utilized to conduct a "Window of Opportunity" trial to study changes in\nbiomarkers associated with proliferation and progression. It is completely safe for\nwomen with DCIS to participate in a placebo-controlled study for four weeks prior to\nsurgery. Four weeks is the approximate time needed for surgical scheduling at most\ninstitutions. In many cases the length of time between diagnosis and treatment can be\nmuch longer if patients wish to undergo immediate breast reconstruction or decide to\nget a second or third opinion. Because patients will undergo a needle biopsy for\ndiagnosis and surgical excision as part of their standard of care for DCIS, women will\nnot be put at any additional risk to have an additional breast procedure or be\ninconvenienced to participate in the study. A placebo arm has been included to control\nfor reductions in Ki67 that can occur during the treatment window which have been\nobserved in other window of opportunity studies and to allow for a more robust\nstatistical analysis.	Primary Objective:\nTo determine if CE/BZA reduces proliferation as measured by Ki-67 protein expression\nSecondary Objectives:\nTo determine if CE/BZA modulates expression of ERα, progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor\nreceptor 2 (HER-2).\n To determine if CE/BZA modulates a previously validated set of\nepithelial markers of progression.\nTo determine if TSECs will restore expression of the stromal marker CD36 and repress pro-tumorigenic ECM proteins and\nsoluble factors.\nTo determine if a short intervention with CE/BZA results in any difference in Quality of Life (QOL) as it relates to menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women with DCIS.\nTo determine if a short intervention with CE/BZA has a favorable side effect profile compared with other endocrine therapy\ninterventions using the validated Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Eight Symptom Scale (BESS) questionnaire.\nExploratory Objectives\nTo determine if CE/BZA alters expression of estrogen-modulated genes and elicits novel ER dependent-gene signatures in breast epithelium\nTo demonstrate that CE/BZA does not upregulate Anterior Gradient 2 (AGR2), a marker of ERα agonist activity.\nTo determine if CE/BZA will modulate some aspects of immune function as measured by a switch to a M2-type pro-tumorigenic macrophage signature and an immunosuppressive T cell signature.\nTo determine if a short intervention with CE/BZA alters expression of estrogen-modulated genes and elicits novel ER\ndependent-gene signatures in the breast stroma.\nTo determine if CE/BZA affects plasma concentrations of BZA in patients with the UGT1A1*28 gene polymorphism.	The primary endpoint is proliferation as measured by the change in Ki-67 between the\nbaseline core biopsy and the surgical specimen after an intervention with CE/BZA or placebo.\nThe secondary endpoints include assessing changes between the core biopsy and surgical\nspecimen in markers of progression changes in hormone receptor (ERα and PR expression),\nglobal expression profiling, stromal markers, macrophage markers, immune markers, and\nQOL between CE/BZA and placebo.	1	3.1 Inclusion Criteria\n3.1.1 Women must have newly diagnosed histologically confirmed ER (+) DCIS scheduled to undergo surgical therapy. The pathology report (signed pathology report from attending pathologist) from each individual institution will be used to determine eligibility.\nNote: After the patient has completed the study and the slides have been sent to NU, our pathologists will review the slides to confirm the diagnosis.\nNote: DCIS suspicious for micro invasion is eligible on core biopsy. This is due to the fact that many these patients will not have invasion on final pathology.\n3.1.2 DCIS must be ≥ 1cm based on extent of calcifications, presence of a mass on ultrasound OR enhancement on MRI\nOR\nDCIS must be ≥ 5mm of DCIS on one single core. Can be < 5mm if DCIS is identified on multiple cores (at least 2 cores)\n3.1.3 Women presenting after excision with positive margins are eligible. Ki-67, Cox-2, P-16, expression in immediately adjacent tissue is similar to what is found in DCIS. Note: Positive margins are defined as DCIS present at the inked margin or\nDCIS <1mm from the margin. Note: Positive margins are defined as DCIS present at the inked margin or\n3.1.4 Women must be postmenopausal (defined as no menstrual cycle for 12 months or surgical history of bilateral salpingoopherectomy. Postmenopausal women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible to participate for this trial. Men are not eligible. Note: women who have had a hysterectomy without a bilateral salpingoopherectomy may still be pre-menopausal. Confirmation of post- menopausal status is required for these patients and will be measured by testing levels of estradiol, progesterone and FSH (lab ranges per institutional standards). In addition, confirmation of postmenopausal status may be performed in any patient with unclear menopausal status per treating physician discretion.\n3.1.5     Women in the age range of ≥18-75 (inclusive)\n3.1.6     ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).\n3.1.7 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below Leukocytes               \n3.1.8     Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication\n3.1.9 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document and comply with all procedures\n\n3.2     Exclusion Criteria\n3.2.1 Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. A minimum of 4 weeks wash-out period is required for eligibility. Please contact Principal Investigator, Dr. Swati Kulkarni for further clarification\n3.2.2 Patients with a "currently active" second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers.

(I.e. same class of drug as CE/BZA)\n3.2.4 Current HRT, SERM or Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) use. If yes, the wash-out period is 30 days before diagnostic core needle biopsy. Note: Local therapy (i.e. estrogen cream) will be permitted due to low systemic absorption of estrogen.\nNote: if patient is registered prior to completed washout, diagnostic core needle biopsy date will need to be provided.\n3.2.5 Confirmed current or past diagnosis of invasive breast cancer\n3.2.6 History of gynecologic malignancy that is estrogen dependent\n3.2.7 Patients with recurrent ipsilateral DCIS\n3.2.8 Active deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis,and any arterial thrombosis including stroke and myocardial infarction or history of these conditions\n3.2.9 Known protein C, protein S, or anti-thrombin deficiency or other known thrombophilic disorders\n3.2.10 Unexplained/undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding (concern for undiagnosed endometrial cancer)\n3.2.11 Women who are pregnant or lactating. CE/BZA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.\n3.2.12 Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and UGT are ineligible. The wash out period for such drugs is a minimum of 7 days or 5 half-lives whichever is shorter. Refer to Appendix C.Note: As this list is constantly evolving, if a medication is incorrectly documented as prohibited in this protocol, documentation from the site pharmacist to the contrary will be acceptable for the purposes of registration.\n3.2.13 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with\nstudy requirements.	Currently the study is enrolling at the following institutions, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, John Hopkins, Washington University in St. Louis and Northwestern University.  Currently, there are 3 sites undergoing IRB review (University of California at San Diego, Northwestern Medicine: West Region and Thomas Jefferson University). A total of 10 actively enrolling sites would be ideal for this project.	All participants will be blinded and will either receive CE/BZA tablets or placebo tablets\nto take orally each day for the duration of the study. Drug/placebo will be dispensed in\nbottles of 20 tablets. The patients will be dispensed the entire amount of the drug for\nthe study period (i.e 2 bottles of drug, each containing 20 tablets). The tablets will be\nself-administered. The patients will be asked to take the tablet once a day by mouth\nat the same time each day in the morning (recommended at 8AM + 2 hours). Patient\nshould not miss the dose. If the patient forgets to take a dose or vomits after taking the\nmedication with the tablet visible (within 15 minutes), the patient should take the dose\nas soon as possible within 8 hours of scheduled. Patients will be given a study diary\nwhere they should record the time they take the medication to monitor\ncompliance. There are no restrictions with respect to taking the drug with food.\nHowever, the patient should try to take the medication at the same time each day to\nfacilitate compliance. Patient will take the last dose of medication the day before\nsurgery. The patients will bring back any unused medication on the day of surgery and\nwill return it to the study coordinator.	This study is slated to be completed in 2022, as it is has 60 months of funding.	Participants will complete all visits within 6-8 weeks but will only take study drug for 3-5 weeks.	There are no disclosures/conflicts to provide.	For most aims, the statistical analysis will involve comparison of changes in marker expression between randomized groups. Groups will first be compared on all baseline markers using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and independent sample t-tests or rank sum tests for continuous data. Based on distributional properties, data transformations may be needed before analysis. Assuming parametric methods are used, unadjusted change in a marker will be compared using the independent sample t-test. Log transforming the change data will allow for the comparison of fold-change between groups. If significant baseline differences are seen, follow-up markers will be compared between\ngroups using analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline data. This analysis plan covers the markers described in the study objectives. For analysis of the BESS questionnaire, which is comparing side effects between arms, a generalized linear model with a logit link will be used to compare follow-up side effects. While some markers with semi quantitative\nscales would themselves be compared between arms using a rank sum test, changes in these scales will be compared using similar statistical methods to the primary outcome. With the exception of gene expression profiling, a p-value <0.01 will be used for statistical significance to adjust for multiple comparisons. Analysis of gene expression levels will use a multiplicity adjustment corresponding to a false discovery rate (FDR) of 20%. For RNA-seq data analysis, an\naverage of 16-20 million reads are generated per sample. Fast QC software will be used to check the quality of generated sequencing data. If needed, sequencing reads with phred scores below 30 will be filtered out. The filtered reads will be groomed and aligned to HG19 human genome build using the Top hat software. The assembled reads will then be constituted in transcripts using the cufflinks package. The cufflinks output of control and experimental samples will be merged using cuff merge and differential gene expression estimated by analyzing the merged output using the cuff diff package. Transcripts that have > 1.5- fold expression change (at 20% FDR) between control and experimental\nsamples will be used for downstream analysis, such as to plot heat maps, pathway and gene ontology analysis.	This project currently has 20 patients enrolled of the anticipated 160.  To ensure that enrollment can be completed by year 5 of funding an average of 5-7 patients a month be enrolled nationally.  Recruitment efforts are extremely important to the enrollment goals of this study given the study design of the trial.

The REST Trial	4	This is a two-site, pragmatic non-inferiority clinical trial of two behavioral therapies - cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for adults with chronic bothersome tinnitus.  Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) will be used (1) pre-intervention to define unique personalized symptom phenotypes to predict treatment response and (2) post-intervention to provide patient-centered individualized measures of treatment effectiveness that are more response to change.  The results of the proposed research will assist patients and providers to determine which treatments are best suited for an individual patient, reflecting true personalized medicine.	Multi-site (St. Louis & San Diego), non-inferiority randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving adults with chronic bothersome tinnitus.  The RCT is a comparative effectiveness trial comparing an 8-week course of either CBT or MBSR.  The primary outcome is change in symptoms of bothersome tinnitus as assessed both by standard retrospective patient-reported tinnitus questionnaires and by real-time EMA.  Participants will complete EMA surveys 4 times per day for 3 weeks before and after the intervention(s).	The main goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two behavioral therapies for chronic bothersome tinnitus - cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR).  A second goal is to use smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to define unique personalized symptom phenotypes to predict treatment response.  The proposed research will allow providers to determine which treatments are best suited for an individual patient, reflecting true personalized medicine.	Valid patient-reported outcomes will be used to assess response to treatment. Specifically, at pre- and post-intervention the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) will be used. Pre- and post-intervention ecological momentary assessment data will be captured.	1	Inclusion Criteria\n•\tAdults between the ages of 30 and 70 years.\n•\tSubjective tinnitus of 6 month's duration or greater.\n•\tSignificant tinnitus-related bother as indicated by a response of 3 or greater on the 5-point Tinnitus Global Bothersome scale. \n•\tAbility to give informed consent.\n•\tMust be able to read, write, and understand English\n•\tAvailable and willing to respond to daily smartphone-based assessments for 2 weeks before intervention, immediately after intervention, and 6 months later.\n•\tAvailable and willing to participate in 8 weeks of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CPT) or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) according to the randomization plan and return for follow-up at six months after completion of the assigned intervention.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n•\tPatients with symptoms of depression as evidenced by a score of 10 or greater on the PHQ-9.48\n•\tPresence of an acute or chronic unstable medical or psychiatric (including alcohol or substance dependence) condition, which, in the opinion of the research team, would prevent them from successfully participating in the study. \n•\tCurrently taking medication for depression, anxiety disorder, or similar psychiatric condition for less than one month or not having a stable dose of said medication.\n•\tCurrently undergoing other treatments for tinnitus.	Two sites - 1. Washington University in St. Louis - WU Faculty Practice Plan, BJC Medical Group.\n2. University of California San Diego Health Physician Network	Two behavioral therapies - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).  Each will be delivered as an 8-week group therapy.	5 years. Enrollment starts 6 months after start of trial and continues till the end of the 5th year (Month 60).	14 weeks - 2 weeks of pre-intervention assessment, 8 weeks of behavioral therapy, 2 weeks of immediate post-intervention assessment, and 2 weeks of post-intervention assessment at 6 months post-intervention.	\N	The noninferiority analysis will be performed using the RISKDIFF option in frequency procedure in SAS. The RISKDIFF option is used for testing noninferiority and the Farrington-Manning score test is used to maintain the pre-set type 1 error rate. In addition to the noninferiority test results we will estimate the response rate difference between the 2 intervention groups together with the 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval. If the upper limit of the 97.5 % confidence interval is lower than the noninferiority margin of 5% we will conclude noninferiority of MBSR to CBT.	Participants will be recruited in a variety of ways, including posters/flyers, social media, website, local television and print media, OASIS, Trialspark (UCSD), participant research registry (WU), and community- and practice-based research networks affiliated with Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).   The CTSA Community Engagement Cores at WU (Center for Community-Engaged Research (CCER) and Reach Engagement to Advance Community Health (REACH) Initiative) and at UCSD (Participant Recruitment Center, Community Engagement (CE), and Biomedical Informatics units) will serve as key resources to identify appropriate community organizations to engage and facilitate the recruitment.  The American Tinnitus Association and its affiliated Tinnitus Support Groups in St. Louis and San Diego (see letters of support) will provide resources for advertising and marketing the study. To aid in the recruitment and retention process, we will consult with the Recruitment Innovation Center (RIC) at Vanderbilt University during the planning phase (first 6 months) of the study. The RIC, which is a part of the CTSA-sponsored Trial Innovation Network, works with researchers to improve participant recruitment and retention, especially among individuals from underrepresented groups in research. \nBoth sites to be initiated by Month 6.\nEach site will enroll 224 subjects total over 42 months.\nTime to enroll planned number: 42 months.\nYes prior research at Washington University.\nRecruitment efforts are very important to meeting our goal.

This will be followed by a cluster randomized effectiveness trial of a policy of early intervention with image-guided, catheter-directed utilization of thrombolytic (alteplase) and the CLEAR 4 treatment endpoint of >85% clot removal	Efficacy Trial:  375 subjects will be enrolled in this single blind adaptively randomized outcome trial.  The aim of the study is to compare the acute use of optimized/image guided EVD placement combined with alteplase (first 12-48 hours from diagnostic CT), with the goal of > 85% removal of clot, with standard practices including EVD alone and conservative (non-surgical) treatment of large intraventricular hemorrhage ≥17.5 mL).  Randomization allocation will 1:1 between image-guided EVD + alteplase and Standard Care Practices.\n\nEffectiveness Trial:  The Effectiveness phase will be predicated on \ndemonstrating a 10% shift in mRS and mortaltiy in efficacy trial.  This \nunblinded study is designed to test if use of the CLEAR IV selection criteria \nand treatment endpoint produce similar results to the Efficacy trial in a general population of IVH subjects where the stroke teams are trained but unmonitored. This is a step wedge cluster randomized trial design in which the intervention (early use of optimized and/or image guided EVD placement and alteplase within 12 to 48 hours of diagnostic CT) is introduced over a number of time periods, the order in which each cluster begins the intervention being determined at random. All clusters (sites) will receive the intervention by completion of the trial. Once a site switches to the intervention, it does not switch back to the control (standard care). The primary outcome is a comparison of 30 day mortality and functional outcome as measured by the percent of subjects returning home in 30 days between subjects in the effectiveness and efficacy trials.	Efficacy Trial\n\nPrimary objective: To determine if early (first 12- 48 hours) acute use of image-guided, targeted, dual EVD placement and intraventricular thrombolytic (alteplase) with the goal to remove >85% of clot will lead to improved mRS and mortality compared to standard practices.\n\nSecondary objectives: \nTo determine if patients receiving EVD + alteplase in contrast with patients receiving EVD alone or conservative management attain better scores on the secondary measures of efficacy, which include:     \n     (1)  whether 30 day mortality and disposition (site at which subject resides) predicts 180 day mortality and mRS/eGOS (extended Glasgow Outcome Scale) status;\n     (2)   whether mRS and eGOS correlate with patient perceived well-being as measured by SIS, EQ-VAS and subject location at 180; discharge to home / rehab correlates with mRS/eGOS status; \n     (iii)  Demonstrate that performance of the CLEAR intervention does not vary by site\n\nEffectiveness Trial\n\nPrimary objective:  To test if use of the CLEAR IV selection criteria and treatment endpoint produce similar results to the Efficacy trial in a general population of IVH subjects where the stroke teams are trained but unmonitored.  We propose to test the hypothesis that early use of image-guided EVD and alteplase will produce improved 30 day mortaility and functional outcome as measured by percent of subjects returning home in 30 days. \nSecondary objectives: \n(1) To demonstrate that compliance with interventional goals relates to mortality and functional benefits\n\n(2) To verify that compliance with safety plan for EVD-related minor bleeding correlates with the overall rate of delayed, treatment related secondary hemorrhage.\n\n(3) To show that  major variations in selection are not associated effect including: \n     (a) time to treatment, \n     (b) subgroups by disease severity do not differ in their response to treatment, and \n     (c) subgroups stratified by co-morbidities such as The Charleson Index and an the do not differ in complications or response to treatment.\n(4) Discharge to home / rehab correlates with mRS/eGOS status	Primary Endpoint:\nEfficacy Trial Primary Endpoint: Improved Modified Rankin Scale ≤ 3 and function(returning to home)  at 30  days	1	Main Inclusion Criteria for both Efficacy and Effectiveness Trials\n\n1.\tAge 18-80.\n2.\tSymptom onset less than 24 hrs prior to diagnostic CT scan.\n3.\tSpontaneous ICH ≤ 30 cc and IVH >17.5 ml obstructing 3rd and/or 4th ventricles.\n4.\tCTA demonstrating unequivocally no vascular wall defect, angiogram required for equivocal studies\n5.\tICH clot stability: ICH must be ≤ 30 cc on initial presentation and not exceed 35 cc on subsequent pre-randomization stability scans\n6.\tIVH clot stability: IVH must be ≥17.5 mL on initial presentation.  \n\nMain Exclusion Criteria\n1.\tSubjects presenting more than 48 hours after IVH\n2.\tSuspected (unless ruled out by angiogram or MRA/MRI) or untreated ruptured cerebral aneurysm, ruptured intracranial AVM, or tumor.

This means that the treatment period varies among different patients, depending on time of enrollment.	\N	The statistical comparison of the two randomized arms with respect to the primary endpoint will be a time-to-event analysis and, therefore, will be based on the time from randomization to CV mortality. The Cox proportional hazards regression model will be the primary tool to analyze and assess outcome differences between the two treatment arms. The Cox model analysis will include variables for treatment group, country/region, status at enrollment (inpatient or outpatient), age, enrollment LVEF, and sex.

We hypothesize that fluid resuscitation with LR will reduce hospital mortality compared to NS for children treated in an ED setting for septic shock.    Our hypothesis is based on an increasing body of literature supporting superior efficacy and safety for buffered/balanced fluids (in the US, this is most commonly lactated Ringer's [LR]) compared to non-buffered 0.9% normal saline (NS).  NS contains a supra-physiologic concentration of chloride (1.5X that of plasma) and a strong ion difference (SID) of zero but is isotonic compared to extracellular fluid.  Balanced solutions have less chloride, small amounts of additional electrolytes, and a higher SID due to the presence of an anion buffer.(6,7)  The high chloride content and low SID of NS has been associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), acidemia, hyperkalemia, vascular permeability, inflammation, coagulopathy, fluid overload, and death.(8)  For example, infusion of NS reduced renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate in a dog model to a greater extent than more balanced fluids.(9)  In healthy human volunteers, infusion of NS also led to impaired cognition that was not evident with similar volumes of balanced fluids.(10)  Although the clinical importance of NS-induced acidemia is uncertain,(11) such a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is pro-inflammatory in cell culture(12) and has been associated with mortality after surgery(13) and adult critical illness.(14)    Several studies have compared the effects of infusions of NS and buffered crystalloids on patient outcomes.  In a sequential period study of critically-ill adults, use of chloride-restrictive fluids reduced AKI by almost 50%.(15)  However, the SPLIT crossover trial in 2,278 critically-ill adults found no differences in AKI or mortality for chloride-restrictive versus NS fluid.(16)  Similarly, in the CRISTAL open-label randomized trial of adult ICU patients with hypovolemic shock, 31% of 72 patients who received LR died compared to 27% of 1,035 who received NS (p=0.49).(17)  In contrast, in a propensity-matched observational study of 6,730 adults with vasopressor-dependent septic shock, balanced fluids were associated with a 14% relative reduction in hospital mortality.(18)  In a meta-analysis, adult septic patients who received balanced fluids had a trend towards a lower mortality than those that received NS (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58, 1.05) although no trial directly compared NS to balanced fluids.(19)  In a randomized trial of 65 adults with trauma, resuscitation with balanced fluids improved acid-base status and decreased hyperchloremia.(20)  Finally, in adults undergoing abdominal surgery, use of balanced fluids was associated with fewer post-operative infections.(21)     Two trials comparing balanced fluids to NS are ongoing in adult shock (PLUS study in septic shock, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02721654 and SaLT-ED study in all shock, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02614040).  However, neither trial includes children.  Some have already recommended to abandon NS,(22) but we believe that the lack of definitive data precludes such a widespread change without purposeful testing of our hypothesis in a large trial that includes children.(23)	We propose a large pragmatic two-arm RCT comparing fluid resuscitation with LR (intervention arm) and NS (control arm) in children with septic shock.  As shown in Figure 1 (in attachment), eligible patients will be identified as part of clinical practice and, if the treating clinician believes that additional fluid is indicated for abnormal perfusion, then patients will be enrolled and randomized to receive either LR or NS open-label fluid for all further bolus and maintenance fluid until 11:59 pm of the next calendar day.  Closing the study window at 11:59 pm will ensure that all patients receive at least 24 hours of study fluid, which is the time from presentation in which most fluid resuscitation is completed for septic shock.(27)  The volume and need for additional fluid, as well as all other aspects of care, will be at the discretion of the treating team.  After the study window, all care including type of fluid will be at the discretion of the treating team.  The study team will assess patients at hospital discharge (or 90 days from study enrollment, whichever comes first) for vital status (primary outcome, Aim 1), days alive and out-of-hospital by day 28 ('hospital-free days'), time interval from ED presentation to hospital death, use of renal replacement therapy, hospital LOS, and 90-day mortality (secondary outcomes, Aim 1), and will review the medical record for pre-specified adverse outcomes (safety outcomes, Aim 2).    Data collection will be brief and objective (consistent with the tenets of a pragmatic trial (31)) and will include date of ED visit, volume of study and non-study fluids and blood products, age, race, weight, key comorbid conditions, non-study therapies, infectious site/source/microbiology, ED disposition, and data needed to determine outcomes.  Data will be collected locally through a web-based case report form overseen by the data coordinating center (DCC).  Sufficient data will be collected to ensure balanced randomization.    Selection bias will be reduced by regular audits of ED patients to identify eligible patients not enrolled. We will provide targeted education if <95% of eligible patients are enrolled/randomized over one month.  If <80% of eligible patients are enrolled/randomized over two consecutive months, the site will be placed on monitored probation with removal of the site if enrollment/randomization does not increase to >80% within two additional months.  Selection bias will be further reduced by using individual-level randomization to minimize potential for selective enrollment if allocation concealment was broken prior to study enrollment.    Misclassification bias due to assignment cross-over will be monitored by study personnel to ensure that at least 75% of fluid received in the study window is the randomly assigned study fluid.  If <80% of study patients meet this minimum criteria over one month, targeted education to treating clinicians will be provided.  If <70% of eligible patients meet this criteria over two consecutive months, the site will be placed on monitored probation with removal of the site if >75% compliance with study fluid administration is not achieved within two additional months.	Aim 1:  To test the hypothesis that fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's will reduce hospital mortality compared to fluid resuscitation with 0.9% normal saline in pediatric septic shock.    The primary efficacy outcome will be all-cause hospital mortality. Secondary efficacy outcomes will be days alive and out-of-hospital by day 28 ('hospital-free days'), time interval from ED presentation to hospital death, use of renal replacement therapy, hospital LOS, and 90-day mortality.         Aim 2:  To monitor the safety of lactated Ringer's versus 0.9% normal saline in routine clinical practice.    The safety outcomes will be adverse events previously reported for either LR or NS, including peak blood chloride, lactate, potassium, calcium and minimum blood pH and sodium in study window, thromboembolism, and brain herniation.  Because of the pragmatic study design, safety outcomes will be assessed as they occur in the course of routine clinical practice rather than through a protocolized assessment.(31)	The primary efficacy outcome will be all-cause hospital mortality, censored at 90 days from study enrollment.  Mortality remains an important patient-centered outcome and, in this pragmatic trial, is objective, clinically-meaningful, easily measured, and generalizable.(31)  Moreover, because all-cause hospital mortality is objective, bias imposed by lack of blinding will be minimized.  Alternative primary endpoints, including organ dysfunction-related morbidity, are surrogates for mortality and changes in organ dysfunction in pediatric sepsis have not been clearly linked to changes in mortality.(39)  Organ dysfunction is also substantially more complicated to measure than mortality.  Vasoactive-free days was considered, but prolonged use of vasoactive infusions is rarely necessary in pediatrics, even in children who die.  Hospital-free days was also considered as a primary outcome, but as this composite endpoint includes length of stay, it is more susceptible to factors beyond septic shock itself (e.g., comorbid conditions, social concerns, local practice patterns).  Although much of the potential benefits of LR may be mediated through reduced hyperchloremic acute kidney toxicity, direct assessment of biochemical endpoints or acute kidney injury is less demonstrative of comparative effectiveness if these intermediary outcomes do not translate into more tangible benefits.  Finally, post-hospital outcomes, such as quality of life, are prohibitively expensive to measure with high-quality in such a large cohort of study patients.	2	Entry criteria will be ED patients >6 months and <18 years with clinician concern for septic shock.  Septic shock will be operationalized as 1) an order for parenteral antibiotics for suspected infection, 2) administration of at least 20 mL/kg IV/intraosseous (IO) fluid, and 3) additional fluid planned to treat poor perfusion defined as either hypotension or abnormal capillary refill (per clinician's judgment).  These criteria are adapted from the SCCM/ACCM pediatric septic shock guidelines and commonly used pediatric sepsis trigger tools for the early recognition of septic shock in the pediatric ED setting.(3,5,37)  Only patients expected to receive at least 10 ml/kg of additional bolus fluid will be randomized to receive study fluid for subsequent boluses.  Patients receiving >40 mL/kg IV/IO fluid prior to randomization will be excluded.    We are also contemplating including a plan for enrichment of patient enrollment through Bayesian monitoring of pre-specified sub-groups that may demonstrate a higher probability of differential outcome related to LR versus.  Potential sub-groups that may be selectively enriched include patients less than five years of age and patients with cancer or other immunosuppressive comorbid conditions.	Not provided	The intervention to be tested is fluid resuscitation with LR compared to the 'usual practice' control fluid of NS.     The proposed interventional plan is that, following an initial 20 mL/kg bolus, eligible patients will be randomized to receive either NS or LR for all remaining fluid administration (bolus and maintenance) for up to 48 hours.  For clarity, the study period will end at 11:59 pm on the calendar day following randomization such that all patients receive at least 24 hours of study fluid, which is the time-window from presentation in which most fluid resuscitation is completed for septic shock.(27)  Selective fluid administration has been previously shown to result in widely different amounts of saline use.(38)  Randomization will be performed using 1:1 permuted blocks stratified by age, sex, and site using a web- or PDA-based application.  Study fluids will not be blinded due to costs and interventions that are not in keeping with a simple, pragmatic trial and based on results from the previously published SPLIT fluid trial in which two-thirds of clinicians correctly identified the randomized crystalloid patients received (despite blinding) as electrolyte differences following NS or LR provide clear indication of fluid selection.(16)  All other care will be at the discretion of the clinical team.  As study fluids will not be blinded, patient-level randomization will minimize selection bias due to awareness of group assignment.  Study fluids can be stopped for clinician concerns noted during routine care (e.g., hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, cerebral edema).  Adherence to the study intervention will be monitored remotely through random chart audits and, if need, selected site visits.	Not provided	Not provided	None of the primary investigators, co-investigators, or PECARN site leaders have any financial interests or potential conflicts that might be related to the proposal.	A Mantel-Haenszel statistic, assessing the effect of intervention on all-cause hospital mortality controlling for strata (age, sex, and site), will be calculated to test the hypothesis of no difference.  It is expected that, for both the final analyses as well as interim analyses, the asymptotic version of the Mantel-Haenszel test will be appropriate.  In the case of low outcome counts, a stratified exact score test will be carried out. Specifically, a logistic model will be fit where treatment factor level predicts primary outcome, conditional on stratum, and an exact significance test will be used.  Dichotomous secondary and safety outcomes will be analyzed in the same manner, while continuous outcomes will be analyzed using a Van Elteren test, stratified by the same factors.    Pre-specified subgroup analyses will be performed for the following factors: a) admission to an ICU, b) cancer, and c) abnormal kidney function at presentation. A subgroup effect will be declared significant in a logistic or linear model testing for each particular interaction. Adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons. We will also conduct a post-hoc analysis for patients receiving different amounts of resuscitation crystalloid fluids (<100 ml/kg vs 100-200 ml/kg vs >200) using multivariable regression to account for unbalanced covariates given this analysis will be stratified based on post-randomization characteristics.	Based on local epidemiologic data from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and published national estimates,(40) we expect 190 and 289 children to be eligible per 100,000 annual ED visits.  Since the EDs in PECARN sees 1.1 million visits across its 18 sites per year, we anticipate enrollment of ~2,000 patients/year over 4 years if at least 70% of eligible patients are enrolled.  If additional sites can be recruited through the Trial Innovation Network, subject accrual can be reduced to 3-4 years which will reduce enrollment fatigue at sites and yield faster trial results.  Final data collection, cleaning, analysis, and manuscript preparation will require 1-2 years.  NIH grant submission is targeted for June 2017.

Built on exciting insights into genomic responses of innate immune cells to exercise, we will harness the synergy of the PPG model to simultaneously examine the effect of exercise on: 1) monocytes in preventing the pediatric origins of atherosclerosis (Project 1), 2) natural killer (NK) cells in mitigating the threats to the healthspan found in childhood and adolescent survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (Project 2), and 3) neutrophils in attenuating chronic inflammation in children living with cystic fibrosis (CF) (Project 3). The projects are connected by common themes and aims: 1) exercise in children is not merely play, but rather an essential component of healthy growth and development, 2) the molecular transducers of normal growth interact with the molecular transducers of exercise throughout childhood, and 3) physical activity can affect health not only by actions on 'primary responders,' such as muscle and bone, but through genomic and functional responses in innate immune cells. The studies are designed to take advantage of the rapid growth that naturally occurs from Tanner 2-5, during which weight increases by as much as 40% and growth factors like IGF-1 double. Each project will track its cohort of children for 3-4 years, enabling us to link genomic exercise responses with physiological biomarkers and clinical outcomes over a critical period of growth. We assembled a multidisciplinary team of expert clinicians and scientists to help design the research and guide its analysis, and brought together child health centers across our region to ensure sufficient numbers of participants. Our existing Pediatric Exercise and Genomic Research Center is uniquely qualified to perform cutting-edge cardiopulmonary exercise testing, measurements of body composition, and habitual physical activity, and then to link these data with RNAseq measures of leukocyte transcriptomics and flow cytometry assessment of cell function. Our team includes thought leaders in the emerging bioinformatics disciplines so that we can use systems and network analytic approaches to map the pathways that transduce genomic responses to cellular, metabolic, physiologic, and systemic function. Research in children, a vulnerable population, demands constant innovation of minimally invasive technologies. For example, the PPG is using a newly developed 'on-chip' vascularized micro-organ platform for studying interactions between monocytes obtained from study participants and a surrogate endothelium. The barriers preventing many children from attaining beneficial levels of physical activity are multifactorial, relentless, and global.  Most physically inactive healthy children have few symptoms of disease, but they are at substantial risk for a bewildering variety of cardiovascular, metabolic, and bone disease later in life; these risks are increased in children with chronic disease or disability. This PPG will break down typical research silos and uncover molecular mechanisms that can transform how exercise is used to advance health in children.	PROJECT 1: Mechanisms of Exercise Associated Monocyte Reprogramming: The Role of Childhood Physical Activity in Preventing Atherosclerosis Across the Lifespan    We will track a cohort of children recruited at Tanner 2 (roughly 10-12 y.o.) over a 3-4 year period, through Tanner 5. This is a dynamic interval of pubertal growth during which gene expression is changing spontaneously, body weight can increase by as much as 40%, and growth factors like IGF-1 double. The physical fitness phenotype in the cohort will be measured yearly with cutting-edge cardiopulmonary exercise testing, body composition by DXA, habitual physical activity, and circulating biomarkers of growth, metabolism, and inflammation. These data will be linked with RNAseq derived transcriptomics of monocyte exercise-responsiveness using systems and network-based bioinformatics and statistics. The effect of acute exercise on monocyte subtypes will be measured with flow cytometry. A newly developed vascularized micro-organ platform permits unprecedented visualization and quantification of how monocytes obtained from study participants interact with an in vitro endothelial cell system. Noninvasive ultrasound-based measures that have been validated in children will detect the earliest signs of vascular dysfunction such as carotid intima media thickness and distensibility.    PROJECT 2. Exercise Associated Natural Killer Cell Transcriptomics in Pediatric Survivors of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia: Mechanisms of Enhancing Health    We will test our hypotheses by tracking a cohort of children recruited at Tanner 2-3 (roughly 10-14 y.o.) over a 3-4 year period, through Tanner 5. This is a dynamic interval of pubertal growth during which gene expression is changing spontaneously, body weight can increase by as much as 40%, and growth factors like IGF-1 double. The physical fitness phenotype in the ALL survivors will be measured yearly with cutting-edge cardiopulmonary exercise testing, body composition by DXA, habitual physical activity, and circulating biomarkers of growth, metabolism, and inflammation. These data will be linked with RNAseq derived transcriptomics of NK cell exercise-responsiveness using systems and network-based informatics and statistics. Key NK cell subsets and function will be measured with flow cytometry.    PROJECT 3. Exercise Associated Neutrophil Activation: Enhancing health in children with cystic fibrosis	The long-term goal of our translational research group is to transform how exercise is used to benefit child health. Using the unique synergy that only the PPG mechanism can provide, we propose to explore in novel ways the interrelated molecular mechanisms through which exercise and physical activity influence innate immune cells and ultimately mediate clinical outcomes in diseases and conditions of critical health impact in children and adolescents. We have designed the study to prospectively examine the changes that occur in innate immune cell genomic and functional responses to exercise over a critical period of growth and development. The PPG Specific Aims are:    1.               To examine the impact of exercise on innate immune cell genomics and function in key areas of child health.    a.   In Project 1 we investigate how exercise in healthy children can 'reprogram' monocytes into repair and patrolling cells that ameliorate vascular injury and prevent childhood origins of adult atherosclerosis.    b.   In Project 2 we investigate how exercise in child and adolescent survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia can alter circulating natural killer (NK) cells and mitigate the increased risk of obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, and malignant relapse known to occur in many of these childhood survivors.    c.   In Project 3 we investigate how exercise can alter genomics mechanisms in neutrophils to benefit health in children with cystic fibrosis, a disease marked by chronic pulmonary infection and inflammation, and in whom neutrophil function is altered and physical fitness is associated with improved quality of life and survival (4).    2.               To create a common administrative structure that will oversee and ensure economies of scale in study coordination, study design, statistical analysis, and data management, and ensure best practices in scientific rigor and reproducibility.    3.               To incorporate into the PPG the existing experience and core infrastructure of PERC (UC Irvine's unique Pediatric Exercise and Genomic Research Center) in the conduct of exercise testing and quality control of transcriptomic, flow cytometry, and biomarker analysis required for the individual projects.	As described above, the primary endpoint of the study is the discovery of mechanisms that link acute exercise with monocytes in the prevention of atherosclerosis in healthy children (Project 1); increased NK cell killing in children who survived acute lymphocytic leukemia (Project 2); and improved neutrophil function in children with CF in Project 3.	2	Outlined in the Study Population Section	Not provided.	All participants (healthy controls, survivors of ALL, and children living with cystic fibrosis) will undergo the following annually for the 4-5 years of the proposed grant period:    . Physical Fitness, Body Composition, Pubertal Status, and Habitual Physical Activity. Preliminary Data and Approach: CPET and Exercise Challenge. The paradigm that we developed over the years consists of two acute exercise tests. The child first performs CPET using a ramp type of progressive exercise. The fitness data from the initial test then is used to calculate the work rate for the 10x2 test. The work rate we use is approximately 50% of the difference between the participant's lactate threshold and peak V?O2 (approximately 80% of peak effort). In this way, the work rate is scaled to the child's capability, is sufficiently large to reveal rapidly responsive biomarkers from blood or saliva, and will permit us to compare responses among children and adults of different sizes.    �Body Composition. We have used DXA in pediatric research studies since 2002 to measure lean body mass, bone mineralization, and adiposity (90). Several thousand research DXAs have been successfully performed, including over thousand children and adolescents and approximately 300 infants, leading to a number of research publications (91,92). In a comparison of DXA and MRI, Bridge and coworkers (93) followed a group of 8-11 year old boys and girls and repeated the studies 26-48 months later. They concluded, 'this study validates the common use of DXA in monitoring change in body composition and supports ongoing use in this role in both clinical and research studies.'    �Habitual Physical Activity (HPA). Accelerometry is emerging as a reliable technology for measuring HPA, sedentary behavior, and sleep with improving validity in children (94-98), even compared with more expensive measurements of total energy expenditure such as doubly-labelled water (99-105). Our Consultant Dr. Stewart Trost is an internationally recognized leader in the science of assessing HPA in children (97,98,106). There is increasing evidence for the hypothesis that sedentary behavior independently increases cardiovascular disease risk in children and adults (107-113). Since HPA is only weakly to moderately correlated to physical fitness in children and adolescents and may prove to modulate exercise molecular mechanisms distinctly from aerobic fitness (114), we propose to measure HPA. We have experience using accelerometers and HR monitors in our ongoing training studies, in particular to determine the impact of participation in a chronic exercise training on HPA in adolescents. We use the triaxial accelerometer, the Actigraph GT3X, to assess HPA. As a physical activity assessment device, it has extensive validity and reliability support within the scientific literature, and is used across the globe in large-scale clinical trials as well as smaller-scale research projects involving both children and adults (103-105,115-117).    �Assessment of Pubertal Status. Accurate assessment of maturational status is essential. Physical examination by trained pediatric endocrinologists remains the most reliable way to measure pubertal status (Tanner stage). As noted by Rasmussen et al. (118) in a study of 898 children (418 girls, 480 boys, age 7.4-14.9) and 1173 parents, 'Pubertal assessment by the child or the parents is not a reliable measure of exact pubertal staging and should be augmented by a physical examination.' One of two senior physicians in UCI Department of Pediatrics, Board Certified in Pediatric Endocrinology, will conduct the Tanner staging physical examination. This service will be provided to this research as part of the academic service that is a key requirement of membership in the Department.	Not provided.	Not provided.	No disclosures.	\N	\N

We will enroll 1,350 individuals in a 1:2:2:4 allocation from across the lifespan oversampling younger (age 14 to 26 years) and older (age 65 years or older) participants and recruiting from urban, suburban, and rural locations in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. To develop behavioral phenotypes, each participant will complete a series of validated assessments, which will be analyzed using traditional and advanced data science methods. Our team includes a range of expertise in behavioral economics, physical activity interventions, clinical trials, advanced data science analysis, and a range of adult and pediatric clinical medicine.	This is a four-arm, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a supportive social incentive, a competitive social incentive, or an individual's stated preference (choice of a supportive or competitive social incentive) to increase physical activity relative to control among 1350 overweight and obese individuals, with oversampling in younger (age 14-26) and older (>age 65) participants.	Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of stated preference (choice of supportive or competitive social incentive) compared to random allocation to a supportive versus competitive social intervention in increasing physical activity relative to control. H1a: Each of the three intervention arms will significantly increase physical activity compared to control.

194	2017-08-04	55	\N	\N	Study of vasculopathy and organ system function across the lifespan in sickle cell disease.	Sickle Cell Disease Cohort Study	0	Over the past 30 years, medical care for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) has produced remarkable improvements in life expectancy, particularly in children. However, as SCD has evolved from a fatal disease of childhood into a chronic disease of adulthood with progressive end organ failure (renal, lungs, heart and brain) and early mortality. Currently limited data describes the benefit of disease modifying therapy timing of when end organ progression begins and whether the two Federal Drug Administration (FDA) two approved drugs for decreasing acute vaso-occlusive pain and acute chest syndrome (ACS) attenuate end organ progression. Our preliminary evidence suggests that progressive vasculopathy in SCD impairs function in multiple organ systems, and that more advanced vasculopathy correlated with greater risk of immanent death. We propose a prospective cohort to test the hypotheses that (1) progressive end organ disease is first detectable in the kidneys and ultimately affects the cardiopulmonary system, and that (2) the progression of multi-organ system vasculopathy is attenuated by FDA approved disease modifying therapy (hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, or both) in children, adolescents and adults.	This will be a prospective cohort study with two arms: a large group (10,000 participants) whose clinical data will be collected as standard medical care, and a subset (2,500 participants) who will additionally have annual intensive medical evaluation of organ systems with progressive vasculopathic damage in this disease (cardiac, CNS, pulmonary, and renal). Electronic devices will be used to assess acute vaso-occlusive pain episodes at home rather than only assessing health care utilizations because the majority of acute severe pain episodes occur at home (Smith Annals of Internal Medicine). Participating centers will be CTSA institutions, and data will be abstracted from the EMR through the CTSA hub of the coordinating center. Participants will be recruited from the clinic rosters of participating sickle cell centers. Historically, this population has been very amenable to participating in observational research, and we anticipate up to 90% of patients will agree to participate.  Urine, DNA and plasma samples will be collected from all participants at entry, and the intensive evaluation group will be asked to provide urine, DNA and plasma samples at their annual evaluations for at least 3 years. Biospecimens will be stored at the coordinating center. In addition, genomic data will be compiled from the intensive evaluation group, and linked to deidentified electronic health records in a searchable database. We intend to intend to recruit participants over the course of 5 years, and follow them prospectively for 20 years. Adjudication committees have been formed with international experts for assessment of CNS disease, heart disease, kidney disease, lung disease and patient centered outcomes.

The main focus of this study is to define the clinical epidemiology of SCD in the 21st century.  We propose a prospective cohort to test two hypotheses 1): progressive end organ disease is first detected in the kidneys and ultimately affects the cardiopulmonary system; and hypothesis 2): the progression of multi-organ system vasculopathy is attenuated by FDA approved disease modifying therapy  (hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, or both) in children, adolescents and adults. \n\nAim 1: To elucidate the sequence of organ vasculopathy leading to progressive end organ disease in children, adolescents and adults with SCD. For this purpose, we will follow prospectively two cohorts of individuals with SCD: 10,000 individuals of any age with SCD, whose clinical histories and data will be collected in the course of standard practice at each site (routine care cohort); and individuals from three specified age ranges, will have annual comprehensive evaluation(intensive characterization cohort). \n\nAim 2: To determine the benefit of the only two FDA approved therapies for SCD, provided during routine care (hydroxyurea and L-Glutamine) on rate of progressive end organ disease (microalbuminuria, transcranial Doppler measurements, FEV1 % predicted, elevated TRJV and cognition). For this purpose, in the cohort, we will compare the clinical course of participants that receive hydroxyurea, L- glutamine or both for a minimum of two consecutive years at minimum recommended dose with evidence of adherence to those that either did not receive any therapy, received less than minimum recommend, or intermittent therapy. Potential confounders such as, adherence to medication, lifestyle, demographic factors will be included in the analyses.\n\nAim 3: To establish a SCD biorepository for discovery and validation of novel genetic variants that influence the risk of end organ disease. For this purpose, a single biological sample (blood and urine) will be collected from routine care cohort (n~10,000) and annually, serial biological samples will be collected from the intensive characterized cohort (n~2,500). The St. Jude research team will lead the ancillary genetic studies (separate from this proposal), as they have already established an independent cohort of 1000 individuals with linked clinical and biological repositories and have begun whole genomic sequencing in a subset.	We anticipate that the first phase of this study will be 54 months. We anticipate extension of the study for a second phase that could last for a longer period of time because the clinical epidemiology of SCD cannot be defined in less than 5 years.	240 months	\N	\N	\N

This will result in improvements in both objective and subjective quantifiable clinical outcomes and patient reported quality of life compared with standard neurogenic bladder management as detailed below.	Patients will be randomized to either standard neurogenic bladder management or standard management plus sacral neuromodulation (via S3 nerve root stimulation) in a parallel non-blinded fashion with the intent to demonstrate the superiority of sacral neuromodulation plus standard management over standard management alone.	Objectives: \nAIM 1: To determine the effect of sacral neuromodulation on urodynamic parameters following acute spinal cord injury.\nAIM 2: To assess the impact of sacral neuromodulation on patient-reported quality of life after acute spinal cord injury.\nAIM 3: To examine the impact of sacral neuromodulation on quantifiable clinical outcomes.

Maximum cystometric capacity at 1 year is the primary outcome, and it will be compared between SNM and control arms using restricted maximum likelihood estimation64 under a linear mixed model controlling for institution. An unstructured covariance model will account for serial correlation in outcome measurements. This approach is preferable to a paired t-test or ANCOVA, which would compare the change from 3 months to 1 year and furthermore would not control for institution-related differences.  Our interest here is in estimating the treatment effect at 1 year (primary), 3 months (secondary) and on average over time (secondary), which is straightforward with the appropriate treatment contrasts in the mixed model framework. Additional secondary outcomes (bladder compliance, volume at first detrusor contraction, and presence of detrusor overactivity) will be analyzed similarly, except that a generalized linear mixed model will be used for binary outcomes. \n\nStatistical Power: Sample size calculations for this study were based on a mean maximum cystometric capacity of 220.7 mL (SD=103.3), as reported by Sievert et al, and a feasibility of enrolling 30 patients per arm within the study period. After accounting for a 15% loss to follow-up we expect 25 evaluable patients per arm. To achieve 80% power at a 5% significance level with 25 patients per arm (N=50), we can detect an effect size of a 38% treatment effect (84 mL increase in capacity). An interim analysis will be conducted at 50% enrollment (N=26 after loss to follow-up, 13 patients per arm) accrual, and the decision to stop early will be governed by an OBF significance level of 0.003.  A 0.051 significance level will be used to evaluate the final analysis.\n\nAim 2: We will use a similar linear mixed model framework as described in Aim 1 to compare the mean QOL scores at each follow-up assessment between the intervention (SNM) and control arms controlling for institution. The primary efficacy evaluation will be performed using a linear contrast to compare the mean scores at 1 year between the randomized groups. Secondary contrasts will evaluate intermediate treatment effects at earlier time points, and on average across all time points. Secondary outcomes will include daily number of catheterizations, average catheterization volume, averaged three day 24 hour pad weight, and leakage episodes per day as recorded with a standardized bladder diary. \n\nAim 3: Patients will be monitored regularly at assessments described in Aim 2, and incidence and dates of complications will be determined by patient interviews and review of the medical record. Our primary outcome will be the rate of symptomatic UTIs requiring antibiotic treatment over the past 1 year. We will use a frailty model to handle complications that are potentially recurring events. Events such as the use of anticholinergic medicines for control of detrusor overactivity are simply yes/no indicators during the annual period, and are more meaningfully modeled in the typical Cox regression framework for analyzing single rather than recurrent events.

449	2019-01-03	20	\N	t	Integrating Evidence-Based Smoking Cessation Interventions into Lung Cancer Screening Programs: \nA Randomized Trial	Lung Screening, Tobacco, and Health	4	Lung cancer mortality can be reduced by 20% via CT screening and treatment of early stage disease. Maximum health impact from screening will only be achieved if high-risk smokers undergoing lung screening receive assistance to stop smoking.  While there are several known effective cessation interventions, many of these are not scalable within diverse community-based lung cancer screening programs or with smokers who are not seeking cessation treatment. Our goal is to develop a scalable and cost-effective cessation intervention for widespread implementation to yield the greatest benefits and the lowest costs to both individuals and society.The aims are:  1) To compare intensive telephone counseling (ITC) vs. usual care (UC) standard telephone counseling on biochemically verified 7-day, 30-day, and sustained abstinence. Intervention mediators and moderators will be assessed.  2) To evaluate reach and engagement of the interventions. 3) To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of ITC vs UC, in terms of cost per 3-, 6- and 12-month abstinence rates and quit attempts.	The purpose is to conduct a Phase 3 RCT to test two phone based cessation cessation interventions in the setting of lung cancer screening.  Randomization procedures. At the end of the baseline (T0) interview, subjects will be randomized in blocks of size 4 and stratified by site and readiness to quit (next 30 days vs. next six months/not considering quitting). The site coordinators will access the REDCap system under password-protection, enter the relevant characteristics, receive the assignment, and inform the participant of his/her study arm and of the next steps of the study protocol according to study arm.	1) To compare counselor-initiated telephone counseling (CITC) vs. usual care (UC) referral to standard telephone counseling.  H1.1. At 3-, 6- and 12- months, the CITC arm will have significantly improved biochemically verified 7-day, 30-day, and sustained abstinence, compared to UC. H1.2. Mediators, including teachable moment factors (e.g., perceived risk based on screening results) and process measures (TC and NRT adherence, primary care appointment) will positively affect cessation outcomes at 6- and 12-months. H.1.3. Moderators include screening result, readiness to quit, and nicotine dependence.  For example, we expect that persons with a normal result will have a significantly higher quit rate in the CITC vs. the UC arm, whereas intervention arm will have less of an impact among those with an abnormal result.\n2) To evaluate reach (% of current smokers enrolled) and engagement (% who receive the interventions), both overall and among subgroups (gender, age, nicotine dependence, site).  We will assess intervention fidelity and feasibility for implementation, from community-based to academically-based screening centers.\n3) To conduct an economic analysis to test the hypothesis that while more costly, CITC will be more effective and have greater reach than UC in the lung screening setting, making it more cost-effective in terms of costs per 6- and 12-month cessation rates and quit attempts. We will use these results as inputs to the CISNET model to project the long-term impact of the interventions on costs per life year saved and quality-adjusted life years saved, lung cancer deaths averted, lung cancer mortality reduction, and overall population mortality.	At 3-, 6- and 12- months, the CITC arm will have significantly improved biochemically verified 7-day, 30-day, and sustained abstinence, compared to UC.	1	We will enroll individuals who: 1) are 55-80 years old (USPSTF eligibility criteria142 are 55-80, although Medicare goes only to 77); 2) have a >30-pack year smoking history; 3) are current cigarette smokers, regardless of the number smoked per day; 4) English or Spanish-speaking; 5) ability to provide meaningful consent, 6) registered to undergo screening at one of our sites; and 7) accrued prior to screening. The exclusion criterion is prior lung cancer. Current smokers are eligible to participate regardless of prior lung cancer screening or prior cessation treatment. Smokers not yet ready to quit will be encouraged to participate.	Screening Sites: We describe each site here, in Table 2, in the letters of support, and in Resources and Environment.  All 5 screening sites have an ongoing screening program and are part of a major medical center, which includes a thoracic tumor board, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, surgeons, pulmonologists, and palliative care members, who will provide diagnostic work-ups and treatment as needed.  The Georgetown site (DC) was one of the original 10 NLST screening sites and has screened over 160 persons since the clinical screening program began in 2013. The Lahey site (MA) has provided free lung cancer screening to over 3000 individuals since 2012 and is one of the leaders in developing clinical lung screening programs.  Hackensack (NJ) has screened over 130 since beginning screening in 2014.  Miami Baptist (FL) has screened over 1500 individuals since 2014, 40% of whom are Hispanic. Hartford Hospital (CT) has screened 270 individuals over 12 months. Importantly, although Lahey and Baptist are already operating at close to capacity, the other 3 sites are continuing to increase the annual number screened.  We have added two additional sites:  Unity Point in Moline Illinois, and Medstar Shah Medical Group in Hollywood, MD.	In the intensive arm, participants receive up to 8 telephone counseling sessions and up to 8 weeks of nicotine patch at the dose appropriate to current smoking levels.  These are mailed in two week batches and are contingent on continued participation in the telephone counseling.  \nIn the usual care are, participants receive up to 3 telephone counseling calls and  2 weeks of nicotine patch at the dose appropriate to current smoking level.	48 months	12 months	no conflicts of interest	C.9.d. Data Analyses:  We will calculate descriptive statistics and perform bivariate analyses using t-tests, χ2 tests (or Fisher's exact tests), and Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients to evaluate the associations of baseline factors (demographics, smoking history, lung cancer screening history, etc.) with the potential mediators (e.g. perceived risk for lung cancer, adherence to TC and NRT, and other pharmacotherapy use) and outcomes at 6- and 12-months. Baseline variables that are significantly associated with outcomes and mediators (p<0.05) will be included in the subsequent multivariable models.\nAim 1:  H.1.1. At 6- and 12- months, we will use logistic regression models to compare the study arms on the primary outcomes of verified abstinence and the secondary outcomes of intent to quit (next 30 days vs. next six months/not considering quitting) and quit attempts (any attempt vs. none). These models will include all baseline variables associated with the outcome of interest (p<0.05). We will calculate adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between study arm and the binary outcomes of interest. \nH.1.2 For the moderation analysis, we will add the hypothesized moderators one at a time (e.g. screening result, readiness to quit, and nicotine dependence) together with their interaction with study arm to the statistical analysis described above. If the interaction terms are significant (p<.05), we will report stratum-specific (e.g., separately for abnormal vs. normal results) ORs and 95% CIs for the association between study arm and outcome. We will also explore the role of age and gender as moderators using similar methods.  \n\tH.1.3. For the mediation analysis, we will use the product of coefficients method to evaluate the 3 hypothesized mediators. We will first use separate regression models to estimate the coefficients relating the study arm to each of the hypothesized mediators (perceived risk for lung cancer, adherence to TC and NRT, PCP contact, and use of other pharmacotherapy) treated as outcomes at this first step. We will use linear regression models for the perceived risk for lung cancer and NRT adherence, a Poisson regression model for TC sessions completed, and logistic regression models for having had PCP contact re cessation, and the use of other pharmacotherapy. For the second step, we will use logistic regression models to estimate the standardized coefficients relating each one of these 3 mediating variables to the binary outcomes (e.g., abstinence at 3-, 6- and 12-months). We will calculate each mediated effect as the corresponding product of these coefficients, with corresponding 95% CIs estimated according to the methods from MacKinnon et al.173  In sensitivity analyses we use methods involving inverse propensity weighting to address situations when there are baseline variables that interact with the treatment.174\n\nAim 2. To assess reach (the absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of individuals who enroll) and engagement (% who receive the interventions), we will calculate descriptive statistics and perform tests to compare reach proportions, including chi-square tests overall and between subgroups (gender, age, nicotine dependence, and site). We will explore reach and engagement among Hispanic and non-white participants, although we are likely to be underpowered.  Engagement will be defined in several ways, including the % who receive > two TC sessions, % who receive > 4 sessions; % who use >2 weeks of NRT, etc.)  We will also assess the implementation endpoints of TC intervention fidelity and the ease of delivery (effects on clinic workflow). Finally, we will assess the impact of the interventions (defined as reach X effectiveness).	At present, we have accrued approximately 650 of the expected 1330 participants, beginning in June 2017. We are on track to complete accrual in May of 2020.  We have about a 32% participation rate (we had expected a 45% rate based on pilot data).  The larger concern for us is retention, as we lose 20% at the first follow up and another 13% at the next follow up.  We presently pay participants $15 at 3, 6, and 12 months for completing the telephone interview, and an additional $25 at each time point for completing the biochemical verification for those who have quit.  \n\nHowever, our concern about accrual is among Spanish speakers.  We had anticipated that there would be a fairly large number of Spanish only or Spanish preferred speakers at our Miami site.  However, there are fewer than anticiapted, but we are also struggling to accrue those who do register for lung screening.  The people conducting the accrual are native Spanish speakers and our counselor is a native speaker, so we do not believe that it is a communication problem.  But there is something that we cannot identify that is making Spanish speakers more reluctant to participate than English speakers.  \n\nFrom the grant:  \nC.6. Procedures. \nC.6.a. Accrual, Consent, and Baseline (T0) Telephone Assessment. At each site, individuals are referred by their PCP for screening. During the initial call with a patient, the scheduler informs smokers that the site coordinator will contact them about study participation. When possible, the scheduler will transfer the patient directly to the site coordinator.  Otherwise, the site's coordinator will contact newly scheduled smokers by retrieving them from the site's secure internal database. The proposed procedures, in which accrual is conducted by staff from each screening site, will provide access to all eligible individuals, which will significantly improve reach compared to the pilot study. The site coordinator will make up to five call attempts to describe the study, obtain verbal consent (Human Subjects section), and complete the 15-minute baseline (T0) interview (Table 3) and randomization. The goal is to reach participants within 1-3 days of the screening registration, although in many cases, the screening appointment is not scheduled for several weeks, providing ample time for study enrollment. As part of study consent, participants will understand that the follow-up assessments and TC will be conducted by Georgetown staff. To guard against loss of data, responses to all interviews will be recorded on paper and then entered into REDCap by the coordinator. REDCap156 is a secure, IRB-approved, web-based application designed for managing online databases and for communication between study sites.  Once the data are entered and thoroughly checked, the hardcopies will be destroyed.  \n Following the baseline interview, Georgetown staff will access new participants in REDCap each weekday and mail the study description including the participant's randomization arm, and 2 copies of the consent form and a stamped return envelope. Importantly, it is not feasible to conduct in-person accrual, as individuals do not come to screening centers prior to their screening day. Consequently, we conduct enrollment by phone in order to complete the baseline assessment of current smoking status and readiness to quit prior to screening.  As a minimal risk study, we have received approval from the IRBs at our 3 pilot study sites to proceed with verbal consent for the baseline interview, followed by mailed written consent.  We have experienced no adverse events or participant complaints using this approach.
268	2018-01-19	55	\N	\N	The Effect of ED and After-ED Analgesic Treatment for Pediatric Long Bone Fracture Outcomes	ED Pediatric Fracture Outcomes	6	We will perform a prospective multi-center, longitudinal comparative effectiveness study that capitalizes on the known variability in pain treatment to determine the most effective analgesic regimen for children with fracture pain. For children 4-18 years old with long-bone fractures who are discharged home from the Emergency Department (ED) we hypothesize children recommended both opioid and non-opioid analgesics for use after ED discharge will have better function compared to those prescribed only an opioid analgesic. Additionally, children with improvement in pain from moderate/severe to mild/no pain during ED care will have better function compared to those discharged with persistent moderate/severe pain.	This is a prospective observational study of 14,000 children ages 4-18 years with an isolated long bone fracture that are discharged home from six enrolling centers. The parents of children with a long-bone fracture discharged from an Emergency Department will be enrolled during their ED visit. Data from the ED visit are available in the PECARN Electronic Health Record Registry and are linked to patient reported outcomes collected by a mHealth texting platform called AT-HOME during the two weeks after discharge.	For children 4-18 years old with long-bone fractures who are discharged home from the ED, we will address the following aims:\n\nSpecific Aim 1:  To assess the differential impact of recommended analgesic regimens for after-ED care by comparing the pain-related function during the first week after ED discharge.\nHypothesis 1a: Children with long bone fractures recommended both opioid and non-opioid analgesics for use after ED discharge have better function compared to those prescribed only a non-opioid analgesic.\nHypothesis 1b: Children with long bone fractures recommended both opioid and non-opioid analgesics for use after ED discharge have better function compared to those prescribed only an opioid analgesic.\n\nSpecific Aim 2:  To determine if more effective pain treatment during ED care is associated with better pain-related function during the first week after ED discharge. \nHypothesis 2: Children with long bone fractures with improvement in pain from moderate/severe to mild/no pain during ED care have better function compared to those discharged with persistent moderate/severe pain	Primary Outcome: Pain-related function will be reported by text using AT-HOME once each day. This will be measured with the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measurement (PPPM). The PPPM is a 15 item observational checklist measure of pain intensity designed to be used by parents to assess acute pain at home. Each of the first seven days after ED discharge, a score will be generated ranging from 0-15. A score of 6 is defined as severe dysfunction. This study will compare the proportion of children that experience severe dysfunction any day after ED discharge for each of the at-home analgesic regimens recommended.\n\nSecondary Outcomes: The number of doses of medications used will be described. This will inform best practice for adequate discharge prescription practices for children with these injuries. A comprehensive panel of measures was developed, and the choice of measures was informed by the Initiative on Methods, Measurements, and Pain Assessment in Clinical trials and reflected both the patient and parent's view of the impact of the treatment recommendation.\n\nThe use of balancing measures including adverse effects assesses the undesirable effects associated with analgesic use. Given the potential for opioid-related adverse effects, ability to detect these, included unused opioids available after the acute pain that may be available for subsequent abuse, misuse, and diversion. \n\nAs a part of secondary analyses, the recommended outpatient analgesic regimen reported will be compared to 1) the prescribed analgesics abstracted from the PECARN Registry, and 2) the analgesic actually used at home obtained via the mHealth AT-HOME Data collection. \n\nPain score at discharge from the ED will also be collected from the family utilizing At-HOME. The AT-HOME score will be reported using the Bieri Faces Pain Scale -Revised. It is considered the most valid and reliable measure of acute pain for school-age children (4-12 years of age), and has been widely used for decades. The scale includes 6 faces to enhance scoring scale compatibility with the 0-10 metric and conforms to a linear interval scale. The scale and instructions for use will be provided to the family at enrollment. On the day of discharge, the child will select one of 6 gender-neutral faces that reflect their pain at discharge, which is scored from 0 to 10. Moderate/severe pain is defined as a pain score of 4 or greater. Mild/no pain is defined as a score less than 4. This self-reported pain scale will provide valid and reliable data about the pain experience at discharge.	2	The parent/guardian of children aged 4-18 years, with an isolated long bone fracture (clavicle, humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, and fibula including reduced fractures) that are discharged home, are eligible for enrollment. If the child has any other injuries or developmental/cognitive delays that make it impossible to report outcomes of interest, the parent/guardian is not eligible. If the parent/guardian is unable to understand English or Spanish, or is inaccessible by text or phone he/she will be excluded. The parent/guardian will be consented in the ED to report their experiences after discharge.	Strategically selected sites within PECARN will enroll patients including: Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (Chicago, IL), Children's Hospital Colorado (Denver, CO), The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA), Children's National Medical Center (Washington DC), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH), and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI). One of the key strengths of this proposed study is the diverse population of children that is captured, and the well-developed infrastructure of PECARN, within which we can successfully meet our research aims. The participating EDs represent a variety of geographic settings and ethnicities across the United States. These sites have successfully participated in multiple research projects in the past through PECARN. These features of the study population/setting support the feasibility of study completion and will enable us to generalize our findings.	This is not an interventional study.	Study enrollment will start Month 7 of funding and data analysis will be completed during Month 61 (end of Year 5).	Each individual participant will be enrolled during the Emergency Department visit. . At enrollment, the time most convenient to receive queries about outcomes of interest will be determined. Texts or phone calls will be sent daily for 7 days and then every other day until 2 days have passed with no reported functional impairment. The final communication includes a question regarding storage and disposal of left-over analgesic and will completed  with 21 days of enrollment.	No disclosures or conflicts of interest have been identified.	Summary statistics will be used to examine distributions and interrelationships. The PECARN Registry has been queried in the development of this analytic plan. To account for differences in patient/biological characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), including severity of fracture variables such as extremity site (upper/lower), fracture reduction (N/Y), moderate/severe ED pain severity, we will utilize propensity score methods. Specifically, relevant biological variables such as sex will be accounted for in the analysis. Age and weight, both factors that can affect analgesic effect will be evaluated. The effect of site on medication use and outcomes will be specifically analyzed given the previously described variable practice patterns. We will estimate probability of home analgesic group using a multinomial regression model with predictors/confounders that have been systematically identified a priori by literature review and expert opinion. The predicted log-odds for each group will be used as propensity scores for each patient. We will check for balance in propensity scores across analgesic groups, and for balance in covariates between analgesic groups after stratification by propensity scores. We will use standardized difference and pre- and post-match distribution plot to verify where balance is attained and to select final propensity models. We will then compare analgesic groups with respect to the outcome of severe dysfunction using appropriate methods, based on the distribution of propensity scores. Patients in the group that is prescribed both an opioid and non-opioid will be compared to those in each of the other groups.  \n\nThe analytic plan has been developed to control for bias, adjust for variation in severity and address relevant biological variables including sex. Our Registry query demonstrates cell sizes sufficient to account for severity and sex in our planned analyses.  These threats to validity have been critically appraised since the usefulness of this study and the adoption of its findings are dependent on the adequacy of the study design.\n\nTo account for differences in severity of fracture, patients will be analyzed within the severity cells described. Cells with insufficient numbers within a pain severity group will not be included in the analysis. The primary analysis will be a Mantel-Haenszel test of severe dysfunction, stratified by severity cell to compare the group with mild or no pain at discharge to the group with moderate or severe pain. A secondary analysis will test for an interaction between discharge pain and severity characteristics, using logistic regression. We will also check the consistency of results by looking at sex and within-site results. We will assess the association between discharge pain level and function within each of the severity groups.	A member of the research team will obtain consent and assent of eligible patients in the ED 10 hours per day, 7 days per week at all sites. Dedicated ED research coordinators are available at each of the sites for these hours to enable consistent recruitment of all eligible patients. Once eligibility is confirmed and informed consent is completed, the research assistant will obtain the phone number for communication via text to collect the patient outcomes. At enrollment, each site will implement an existing algorithm that will then assign a unique study ID based on the patient site medical record. Importantly, there will be no change in ED treatment or discharge instructions for study purposes. Families are provided their ED analgesia, discharge education and instructions, as well as discharge prescriptions per ED physician discretion.\n\nEnrollment is expected at all sites by Month 7 and be completed at Month 55.\n\nThe goal to analyze data from 14,000 children would require each of the 6 sites to enroll 2 patients each day (58% of eligible and anticipate seasonal variation) resulting in 4,380 patients yearly. Lost to follow-up rate (due to attrition, phone number change, etc.) is expected to be 20% resulting in 3,504 patients yearly for each of the four years of enrollment, therefore achieving the goal sample size. Preliminary studies of texting follow-up after ED discharge successfully enrolled 66% of eligible parents with 15% lost to follow-up and/or missing data for outcomes reporting.43 These support the feasibility of performing this study. \n\nRecruitment will be monitored on a daily basis and reported on a weekly basis to site investigators.
198	2017-08-16	5	\N	\N	A Community-based Assessment of Skin Care, Allergies, and Eczema	CASCADE	6	This is a pragmatic, multi-site, randomized community-based trial in which dyads of a parent or legal guardian and an infant age 0 to 2 months are enrolled. Participating dyads are randomly assigned to receive lipid-rich emollient with web-based instructions for daily use to infants plus routine skin care instructions (intervention group) or routine skin care instructions alone (control group). Dyads complete surveys quarterly through 24 months. Primary care clinicians trained in atopic dermatitis (AD) diagnostic criteria will document presence of AD at scheduled visits. Our central hypothesis is that emollient therapy from birth can prevent the development of AD.	This is a pragmatic, multi-site, single-blind randomized community-based trial.\n\nIntervention purpose: To test whether emollient therapy from birth can prevent the development of atopic dermatitis.\n\nStudy phase: N/A\n\nAssigning intervention: random assignment in a parallel, pragmatic trial: group 1 (daily emollient), group 2 (no emollient)\n\nNumber of arms: 2\n\nAllocation to arm: Dyads will be automatically randomized after the parent has completed enrollment using a computer-generated randomization schedule. Randomization will be stratified by clinic and parent-reported history of atopic disease in the infant's first-degree relatives at the time of randomization to ensure balance within sites and groups.	Primary Objective\nTo assess the effectiveness of promoting daily emollient therapy beginning in the first 2 months of life in reducing the cumulative incidence of AD at 24 months of age in a community-based setting.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n(1) To determine whether an atopic family history and key early life exposures modify the effect of emollient therapy on atopic dermatitis.\n(2) To assess the effectiveness of emollient therapy on the development of reported allergic comorbidity symptoms such as food allergy and wheeze episodes.	Primary Outcome:\nThe cumulative incidence of AD at 24 months of age as recorded in health records. Clinicians will be trained to use the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Consensus Criteria for diagnosing pediatric AD. Clinicians will assess for AD at each clinic visit and record in the health record.\n\nSecondary Outcomes:\n•\tParental report of provider-diagnosed AD \n•\tAD as diagnosed by the Children's Eczema Questionnaire (CEQ) \n•\tParental report of sleep loss of the infant reported as average number of days per week (1 week recall) of disrupted sleep in their infant measured at 12 and 24 months\n•\tAny prescription topical medication use or over-the-counter hydrocortisone usage recorded by parent or recorded from records review by research coordinator at 24 months\n•\tAsthma risk using a modification of the Asthma Predictive Index\n•\tParental report of immediate food allergy symptoms \n•\tParental report of a provider diagnosis of food allergy that was confirmed by prick testing or IgE blood test.\n•\tGlobal Health Status using one question from the PROMIS Pediatric Global Health (PGH-7) instrument\n•\tIn infants who develop AD:\no\tTime to onset of AD as measured by parental report of eczema age of onset\no\tTime to onset of AD as measured by provider-recorded date of first diagnosis retrieved from record review of health record\no\tAD symptom severity (e.g. itch) as reported by the patient-oriented eczema measure (POEM) instrument\no\tParent-reported global severity of eczema assessment\no\tInfant Dermatology Quality of Life Instrument (IDQOL)	3	All dyads who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible for study participation.\n\nInclusion Criteria\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study all of the following criteria must be true for the dyad:\n1.\tParent can provide electronic signed and dated informed consent form.\n2.\tParent is willing and able to comply with all study procedures for the duration of the study .\n3.\tParent is a primary caretaker of an infant 0 to 2 months of age.\n4.\tParent is 18 years of age or older at time of consent.\n5.\tParent can speak, read, and write in English or Spanish.\n6.\tParent has a valid e-mail address and reliable access to the internet.\n7.\tInfant is a patient of a participating Meta-LARC clinic site at the time of consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria\nA dyad who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:\n1.\tInfant wasborn at less than 25 weeks gestational age.\n2.\tInfant has established eczema as diagnosed by the primary healthcare provider at clinic site of enrollment per parent report.\n3.\tInfant has known adverse reaction to petrolatum-based emollients.\n4.\tInfant has an immunodeficiency genetic syndrome such as Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome or Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome.\n5.\tInfant has extremely low birth weight (less than 1000g or 2.2 lbs at birth).\n6.\tInfant has a sibling enrolled in the study.\n7.\tParent is unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures.	Participants will be recruited from 25 community-based family medicine and pediatric practices from four participating practice-based research networks (PBRNs).\n\nClinical Site Hubs (PBRNs)\n•\tOregon Rural Practice-based Research Network - Oregon Health & Science University (contributing 10 sites)\n•\tState Networks of Colorado Ambulatory Practices & Partners - University of Colorado (contributing 5 sites)\n•\tWisconsin Research & Education Network - University of Wisconsin (contributing 5 sites)\n•\tDuke Primary Care Research Consortium - Duke University (contributing 5 sites)	The intervention for the CASCADE trial will be the full-body application of lipid-rich commercially available, over-the-counter emollient daily for the first 2 years of life.	60 months	24 months	\N	For descriptive statistics, we will present categorical variables as count and percentages and continuous variables as mean with standard deviations. We will treat ordinal variables as categorical in this context. For inferential tests, we present the point estimate and confidence interval. Models should include stratification variables, i.e. family history of atopy and primary clinic where randomized. In the primary analysis, use an overall type I error rate of 0.05 with critical values determined using an O'Brien-Fleming spending function. Secondary outcomes will be considered significant at α=0.05 and exploratory analyses at α=0.1. All tests will be two-tailed.\n\nFor the primary analysis, contrast the risk of diagnosed atopic dermatitis (AD) by two years of age for the intervention versus control groups under an intention-to-treat (ITT) assumption, analyzing all subjects according to the group to which they were allocated regardless of adherence or group cross-over, and imputing missing outcome values using multiple imputation methods. \n\nThe model for the binary outcome of AD by 24 months of age will include a variable for study arm (intervention=1, control=0) to be evaluated with a Wald test of the coefficient at the 0.047 level of significance, which gives an overall α=0.05 subsequent to analysis. Because randomization will have been stratified by clinic and family history of atopy in a first-degree relative (yes/no), include these covariates as fixed effects.17, 18 (While clinics are often modeled as random effects, this approach is problematic in the context of multiple imputation and so fixed effects are preferred.) Estimate the relative risk as the exponentiated coefficient of the study arm variable and report this estimate with its 95% confidence interval. Also report adjusted group prevalence using average conditional predicted risk, and calculate standard errors (SE) and 95% confidence intervals using the delta method, which is a standard method to compute SE of nonlinear transformations and can be executed using Stata's -margins- command, for example.	\N
382	2018-07-24	40	\N	t	Beta1-selective blockade for prevention of postmenopausal bone loss: A randomized controlled trial	Beta1-blockade for bone loss	4	Osteoporosis is a skeletal fragility syndrome of old age affecting ~10 million Americans, while >43 million more have osteopenia. Although several drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of osteoporosis, the potential for serious side effects (e.g., osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femur fractures) and the costs associated with available therapies have led to reluctance on the part of many clinicians and patients to use these approved therapies to prevent clinically significant bone loss. This has led to concern that postmenopausal women must wait until they develop frank osteoporosis (or sufficiently high risk of fracture) to begin drug therapy. Thus, there is a compelling need for novel, relatively low-risk and low-cost pharmacological approaches to prevent and/or treat osteoporosis. This proposal is based on compelling animal and our early clinical data and will test the hypothesis that treatment with a widely used, inexpensive, and relatively β1-selective blocker (atenolol) will prevent bone loss at the lumbar spine and femur neck in postmenopausal women.	We propose a phase 3 study to repurpose an FDA-approved drug, atenolol, for the prevention of bone loss in post-menopausal women. We will perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-year clinical trial.	We will perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-year clinical trial addressing the following Specific Aims:\nAim 1.  (Primary objective) Test the hypothesis that treatment with a widely used, inexpensive, and relatively β1-selective blocker (atenolol) will prevent bone loss at the lumbar spine and femur neck in 354 postmenopausal women as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Aim 1a); and evaluate the tolerability and safety of atenolol when used for the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women (Aim 1b).\nAim 2. (Secondary objective) Evaluate the effects of atenolol on trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture using high resolution-peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT; Aim 2a), on bone turnover markers (Aim 2b), and test whether baseline measures of bone turnover or of sympathetic activity (resting heart rate, plasma catecholamine levels) are predictive of the bone mineral density (BMD) response to atenolol over 2 years (Aim 2c).\nAim 3.  (Secondary objective) In a subset of patients, explore the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms for the effects of β1-selective blockade on bone in humans using analyses of osteoblast populations isolated from these biopsies (Aim 3a) as well as bone histomorphometry of quadruple-labelled bone biopsies (Aim 3b).\nThus, the proposed studies will rigorously test whether atenolol is efficacious and safe for the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women and also further define the mechanisms of sympathetic nervous system effects on bone in humans.	Our primary endpoints will be changes in BMD by DXA at the lumbar spine and femur neck (Aim 1a) along with evaluating the tolerability and safety of atenolol when used for the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women (Aim 1b). Secondary endpoints will include radius, ultra-distal radius, and total hip BMD. Additional secondary endpoints will be changes in trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture at the distal radius and tibia using HR-pQCT (Aim 2a) and in bone turnover markers (CTx, TRAP5b, PINP, osteocalcin; Aim 2b). In exploratory analyses that may have clinical utility for selecting appropriate patients for using a β-blocker to prevent bone loss, we will test whether baseline measures of bone turnover or of sympathetic activity (resting heart rate, plasma catecholamine levels) are predictive of the BMD response to atenolol over 2 years (Aim 2c). Finally, Aim 3 will expand the scope of the clinical trial in a mechanistic direction and explore the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms for the effects of β1-selective blockade on bone in humans using analyses of osteoblast populations isolated from these biopsies (Aim 3a) as well as bone histomorphometry of quadruple-labelled bone biopsies to definitively evaluate the effects of β1-selective blockade on bone formation (Aim 3b).	1	We will recruit normal postmenopausal women (FSH > 20 IU/L) aged 50-70 years. Exclusion criteria will be as follows: 1) clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or fasting plasma glucose > 126 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c > 6.5%; 2) abnormality in any of the additional screening laboratory studies (see below); 3) presence of significant liver or renal disease, malignancy, malabsorption, hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, hypopituitarism, pheochromocytoma, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 4) undergoing treatment with any medications that affect bone turnover, including the following: corticosteroids (> 3 months within the past year or sustained inhaled corticosteroid use, permitting occasional seasonal use), anticonvulsant therapy (phenytoin, carbamazepine within the past year), pharmacological doses of thyroid hormone (causing decline of thyroid stimulating hormone below normal), bisphosphonates (within the past 3 years), denosumab, estrogen therapy or treatment with a selective estrogen receptor modulator, or teriparatide (within the past year). Subjects with a clinical history of osteoporotic fracture (vertebral, hip, or distal forearm) will also be excluded, as will subjects with any recent (within the past 6 months) fracture. As subjects with a spine or femur neck T-score < -2.5 would be candidates for standard osteoporosis drugs, these subjects will also be excluded. If found to have low body stores of vitamin D (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of < 20 ng/ml), subjects will be treated with 1000 units/day of vitamin D for 8 weeks and then rechecked. If the level is still < 20 ng/ml, they will receive a second 8 week course of vitamin D; if, following that, the level is still < 20 ng/ml, they will not be enrolled in the study and will be referred to their primary physician for further evaluation. Additional exclusionary criteria will include any subject with a resting systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or heart rate < 60 bpm. We will also obtain a baseline ECG.	The proposed study is a partnership of 4 CTSA sites: Mayo (Drs. Sundeep Khosla, Matthew Drake, and Ms. Elizabeth Atkinson), Columbia University Medical Center (Drs. Elizabeth Shane, Stavroula Kousteni, David Dempster, Adi Cohen, and Tom Nickolas), Maine Medical Center (Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network, Drs. Clifford Rosen Irwin Brodsky), and UCSF (Dr. Dennis Black). Mayo, Columbia, and Maine all have active clinical trials programs and DXA and will be recruiting sites for the primary study endpoints in Aim 1; Mayo and Columbia both have HR-pQCT devices and subjects from these sites will be studied in Aim 2; the bone biopsies for molecular and cellular analyses for Aim 3 will be done in a further subset of subjects at the Columbia site. Mayo will house the Data Coordinating Center and UCSF will oversee Data Monitoring and Safety activities as well as the DXA and HR-pQCT analyses. In addition, Dr. Robert Recker (Creighton University) will perform the bone histomorphometry analyses in collaboration with Dr. Dempster.	Following recruitment, the subjects will be randomly assigned to placebo or atenolol, 50 mg/day. Block randomization will be used so that equal numbers of subjects will be assigned to each treatment arm for each block of 15 subjects. In addition, we will stratify subjects based on duration of menopause (< 5 yrs versus ≥ 5 yrs) in order to ensure that the 2 groups were balanced for the number of women undergoing the more rapid early menopausal phase of bone loss. Study staff and participants will both be blinded with regards to group assignments. Throughout the study, all participants will take 800 IU of vitamin D that will be supplied to them, unless they are currently taking a multivitamin that contains ≥ 500 IU of Vitamin D. These subjects will be instructed to continue taking their multivitamin daily throughout the study. They will also be counseled on a total calcium intake of ~1000 mg/d. We will obtain resting heart-rate and blood pressure following 5 minutes of seated rest before the blood draws. Fasting blood will be drawn for baseline assessment of bone formation (serum PINP and OCN) and resorption markers (serum CTX and TRAP5b). At the baseline visit, we will also obtain a plasma sample for measurement of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) using a standardized protocol (patient resting in the supine position in a quiet room for 30 minutes and blood drawn through an indwelling catheter). All subjects will be given a blank notebook for recording adverse events. They will be instructed to bring this with them to each appointment for the study team to review and document. The study subjects will return as outpatients to the CRU for assessment of pill counts and fasting morning blood samples at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Height will be obtained with a customized height gauge and weight with an electronic scale. A subset of the subjects (n = 25/group) will also return at 3 months for the bone biopsies for cell analyses and bone histomorphometry (see below, Aim 3). Subjects will need to have nothing to eat or drink after midnight (except water) and no caffeinated beverages or tobacco use for at least 4 hours, as well as avoid strenuous exercise the day previously, prior to all blood samples other than the screen visit. All of the parameters measured at baseline will be measured at each of these time points, except for the plasma catecholamines, which will only be measured at baseline.  Spine, hip, total body and forearm BMD by DXA will be measured at each time point and bone microarchitectural parameters at the radius and tibia by HRpQCT will be measured at baseline, 12, and 24 months. Subjects will also have baseline and endpoint vertebral fracture assessment by DXA, and we will record all clinical fractures during the course of the study.	60 months.	24 months.	\N	Statistical plan is still being developed.	We are preparing an R01 application for submission to NIA for the Feb, 2019 deadline. Recruitment will be at 3 sites (Mayo, Columbia, Maine). As Mayo and Maine have predominantly white subjects, Columbia will focus more on minority recruitment. Each site will enroll 118 subjects over the course of ~18 months. This estimate is base on extensive clinical trial/clinical study experience at each of the performance sites.
332	2018-07-11	55	\N	t	Randomized Evaluation of Beta Blocker and ACE-Inhibitor/Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Treatment in MINOCA patients (MINOCA-BAT)	MINOCA-BAT	4	Myocardial infarction (MI) with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), or MINOCA, is an understudied, important type of MI that accounts for up to 150,000 of the ~805,000 US cases of MI per year. MINOCA is more common among women than men and more common among racial and ethnic minorities, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. A standardized international definition of MINOCA was recently established as MI: a) meeting the universal definition with b) <50% angiographic stenosis in all major epicardial vessels, and occurring c) in the absence of a clinically overt alternate explanation for the MI.  The MINOCA-BAT randomized, controlled clinical trial will test two of these medication types, to see if either or both can improve outcomes in patients with MINOCA.	For interventional trials; the primary purpose of the intervention, the study phase, the strategy for assigning interventions to participants (cross-over, single group, etc.), the number of arms, allocation of participants to each arm, masking/ blinding.\n\n\tMINOCA-BAT is a pragmatic randomized, controlled, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) 2x2 factorial trial testing two pharmacologic approaches to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events among patients with myocardial infarction (MI) with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). It will be the first randomized trial of treatment in patients with MINOCA, who comprise 5-20% of patients with MI. \n\nThe primary objective of MINOCA-BAT is to determine whether oral ACEI/ARB or BB, alone or together, reduces the composite endpoint of all-cause death or hospitalization for MI, ischemic stroke or heart failure in patients with MINOCA and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) >=40% who have no clinical signs of heart failure. \n\nSecondary objectives are to determine whether for patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, EF >=40%, and no clinical signs of heart failure, oral ACEI/ARB or BB, alone or together, reduces all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for recurrent MI, hospitalization for ischemic stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, hospitalization for unstable angina and/or hospitalization for atrial fibrillation. \n\nThere are three safety objectives. 1) To determine whether oral ACEI/ARB and/or BB in patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, EF >=40%, and no clinical signs of heart failure increases hospitalizations for second or third degree AV-block, hypotension, syncope or need for pacemaker. 2) To determine whether oral ACEI/ARB and/or BB in patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, EF >=40%, and no clinical signs of heart failure increases hospitalizations for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. 3) To determine whether oral ACEI/ARB and/or BB in patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, EF >=40%, and no clinical signs of heart failure increases hospitalization for acute kidney injury.\n\nRandomization will take place within 1-30 days of diagnosis of MINOCA. Randomization before hospital discharge will be encouraged. Randomization will be 1:1:1:1, to a) ACEI/ARB and BB, b) ACEI/ARB alone, c) BB alone, or d) neither ACEI/ARB nor BB. \n\nThe total sample size will be 5,608. Of these subjects, 2,108 will be recruited in North America at approximately 205 sites, with funding by this proposal. The remaining 3,500 will be recruited in Sweden and Australia, already funded separately. There will be a uniform protocol at all sites with a single randomization system and standardized eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, database and event definitions.	The primary objective is to determine whether oral ACEI/ARB or BB, alone or together, reduces the composite endpoint of all-cause death or readmission because of MI, ischemic stroke or heart failure in patients with MINOCA and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥40%.\nSecondary objectives: To determine whether oral beta-blockade and /or ACEI/ARB in patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, no clinical signs of heart failure and LVEF ≥40% reduce all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for recurrent MI, ischemic stroke, heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation.\nSafety objectives: 1) To determine whether oral beta-blockade and/or ACEI/ARB in patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, no clinical signs of heart failure and LVEF ≥40% increase readmission because of renal failure, AV-block II-III, hypotension, syncope or need for pacemaker. 2) To determine whether no treatment with oral beta-blockade in patients discharged with a diagnosis of MINOCA, no clinical signs of heart failure and LVEF ≥40% increase readmission because of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.	Primary Endpoint: Time to first occurrence of death or readmission because of MI,\nischemic stroke or heart failure.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: Time to:\n• All-cause death\n• Cardiovascular death\n• Readmission because of AMI\n• Readmission because of ischemic stroke\n• Readmission because of heart failure\n• Readmission because of unstable angina pectoris\n• Readmission because of atrial fibrillation\n\nSafety Endpoints: Time to:\n• Readmission because of AV-block II-III, hypotension, syncope\nor need for pacemaker\n• Readmission because of acute kidney injury\n• Readmission because ventricular tachycardia or ventricular\nfibrillation\n• No other safety events will be collected in this pragmatic trial	1	Inclusion criteria:\n1) Age ≥ 18 years\n2) A clinical diagnosis of MINOCA based on ESC criteria, within the\nlast 30 days. Randomization during the initial hospitalization preferred.\n3) Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40% measured with\nechocardiography, MRI or left ventriculography related to this event,\nprior to randomization\n4) Able to provide written informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria: \n1) Any condition that may influence the patient's ability to comply\nwith study protocol\n2) Previous revascularization (CABG or PCI)\n3) Clinical signs of heart failure\n4) MRI-proven myocarditis or a strong clinical suspicion of\nmyocarditis as cause of the index event. Performing an MRI\nbefore randomization to exclude ongoing myocarditis is\nencouraged but not mandatory.\n5) Contraindications to BB as determined by the treating\nphysician (for BB randomization)\n6) Prior use of BB which must continue according to treating\nphysician (for BB randomization)\n7) New indication for BB other than as secondary prevention\naccording to treating physician (for BB randomization)\n8) Contraindications to ACEI and ARB as determined by the\ntreating physician (for ACEI/ARB randomization)\n9) Prior use of ACE-I or ARB which must continue according to\ntreating physician (for ACEI/ARB randomization)\n10) New indication for ACEI/ARB other than as secondary\nprevention according to treating physician (for ACEI/ARB\nrandomization)	MINOCA-BAT will be carried out as a collaborative global trial in which ~35-40% of patients will be enrolled and followed in North America, while the remaining participants will be enrolled in Sweden and Australia. Approximately 175 sites in the US will be included. \n\nAll sites will be required to have experience in cardiovascular research. Investigators must commit to recruiting the necessary number and diversity of patients to complete the study. They must agree to comply with the MINOCA-BAT protocol and all regulatory requirements recommended in the trial. All enrolling site staff will complete training requirements for participating in the study, which will include NIH or equivalent training in Human Subject Protection and mandatory attendance at an investigator/coordinator training webinar.\n\nTypical study PIs will be cardiologists who routinely care for patients with acute myocardial infarction. Invasive and non-invasive cardiologists are welcome. Specialists in heart disease in women may have particular interest because the problem under study preferentially affects women.	o\tAngiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB)\nPreferred agents and target doses are:ramipril (5-10 mg) or enalapril (10-20 mg) (ACEI) losartan (50-100 mg) or candesartan (16-32 mg) (ARB) \nACEI/ARB should be titrated to maximally tolerated doses. ACEI are preferred but ARB may be used if there is a side effect with ACEI (typically cough) or if the participant was already taking an ARB.

371	2018-07-19	5	\N	t	AtRial Cardiopathy and Antithrombotic Drugs In prevention After cryptogenic stroke	ARCADIA	4	ARCADIA is a multicenter, biomarker-driven, randomized, double-blind phase 3 clinical trial of apixaban versus aspirin in patients with stroke of unknown cause and atrial cardiopathy, defined based on presence of biomarkers of atrial dysfunction. The primary hypothesis that apixaban is superior to aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke and atrial cardiopathy. Eleven hundred subjects will be recruited at 120 sites in the NIH StrokeNet consortium. Subjects will be followed for for the primary efficacy outcome of recurrent stroke and the primary safety outcomes of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and other major hemorrhage.	It is known that anticoagulation with apixaban reduces risk of recurrent stroke in patients with stroke and atrial fibrillation (AF), but approximately 30% of strokes are of unknown cause and AF may remain undetected. The purpose of this trial is to determine whether anticoagulation with apixaban will reduce risk of recurrent stroke in these patients similarly to its effect in AF. Atial cardiopathy is defined based on presence of one of three biomarkers of atrial dysfunction (PTFV1 >5,000 μV*ms on 12-lead ECG; serum NT-proBNP >250 pg/mL; or left atrial diameter index ≥3 cm/m2 on echocardiogram (severe left atrial enlargement).	•\tPrimary: To test the hypothesis that apixaban is superior to aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke and atrial cardiopathy.\n•\tSecondary: To test the hypothesis that the relative efficacy of apixaban over aspirin increases with the severity of atrial cardiopathy.	•\tPrimary efficacy outcome: Recurrent stroke of any type (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or of undetermined type).\n•\tPrimary safety outcomes: (A) Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (including symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke), and (B) major hemorrhage other than intracranial hemorrhage.\n•\tSecondary efficacy outcomes: (A) Composite outcome of recurrent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, and (B) composite outcome of recurrent stroke of any type or death from any cause.\n•\tSecondary safety outcome: All-cause mortality.	1	Inclusion criteria\n•\tAge >=45 years.\n•\tClinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke + brain imaging to rule out hemorrhagic stroke.\n•\tModified Rankin Scale (MRS) score <=4.\n•\tAbility to be randomized no later than 120 days after stroke onset. \n•\tESUS, defined as all of the following:\n-\tStroke that is not lacunar. \n-\tAbsence of extracranial or intracranial atherosclerosis causing ≥50% luminal stenosis of the artery supplying the area of ischemia. \n-\tNo major-risk cardioembolic source of embolism, including AF, intracardiac thrombus, mechanical prosthetic cardiac valve, atrial myxoma or other cardiac tumors, mitral stenosis, myocardial infarction within the last 4 weeks, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%, valvular vegetations, or infective endocarditis). \n-\tNo other specific cause of stroke identified, such as arteritis, dissection, migraine, vasospasm, drug abuse, or hypercoagulability. \nExclusion criteria:\n•\tHistory of AF, AF on 12-lead ECG, or any AF of any duration during heart-rhythm monitoring prior to randomization. \n•\tClear indication for treatment-dose anticoagulant therapy, such as venous thromboembolism or a mechanical heart valve.\n•\tLeft ventricular ejection fraction <30%.\n•\tDefinite indication for antiplatelet agent  (e.g., aspirin or clopidogrel after implantation of a coronary artery stent). \n•\tHistory of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage.\n•\tChronic kidney disease with serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL.\n•\tActive hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency \n•\tClinically significant bleeding diathesis.\n•\tAnemia (hemoglobin <9 g/dL) or thrombocytopenia (<100 x 109/L) \n•\tGI bleeding within the past year \n•\tPregnancy risk	There are 120 sites, all of which are participating in the NIH (NINDS) funded StrokeNet consortium.\nthe StrokeNet consortium is composed of 25 regional coordinating centers (RCCs) each of which has responsibility for several satellite sites. There are a total of more than 300 satellite hospitals participating in the network, and we sent site selection surveys to all sites to determine which ones would be interested in participating, have the proper resources, and also to determine the likely numbers of eligible patients at their sites. We were able to use data from their recruitment success in other similar trials in some instances. We selected 120 sites, and we have a waitlist of 10-20 sites as well. RCCs are responsible for some oversight of the sites in their regional network. Sites are located throughout the US; we have no international sites.	Study treatments to be administered are active apixaban or matching placebo and active aspirin or matching placebo. Blinding will be provided by the use of the same color of formulations, same drug packaging, and same method of drug administration in every subject.\nActive treatment will be either apixaban 5 mg or aspirin 81 mg. An adjusted dose of apixaban 2.5 mg will be used for subjects with 2 of the following: age 80 years, body weight 60 kg, or known serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL. Thus, there will be six possible study tablets: apixaban 5 mg (regular dose), apixaban 2.5 mg (adjusted dose), apixaban 5 mg placebo, apixaban 2.5 mg placebo, aspirin 81 mg, and aspirin placebo. This dosing schema is consistent with previous trials of stroke prevention in AF.21,32 Aspirin will be used as the active control agent since it is the proven, standard-of-care antithrombotic drug recommended for patients with stroke. \nStudy drug and matching placebo will be supplied by the BMS-Pfizer Partnership. Study drug will be sent from BMS-Pfizer to the StrokeNet Central Pharmacy, which will label the study drug bottles, distribute study drug to the sites as they are released to enroll, and resupply sites with study drug as recruitment progresses.	60 months	Minimum of 1.5 years and maximum of 4 years.	The ARCADIA trial is being funded by the NIH/NINDS (U01 NS095869; MPI Elkind/Kamel/Longstreth/Tirschwell). Dr. Elkind is the contact PI and also the Medical Director of the Trial Innovation Network Hub Liaison Team at Columbia University Medical Center. Joanna Vivalda at NINDS is one of our Program Officials and she recommended our considering the Recruitment Innovation Center for help in increasing recruitment for the trial. \nNone of the PIs has any personal conflicts of interest. Study medication is being provided free of charge by BMS-Pfizer Alliance for Eliquis. Roche is providing funding for collection of samples for laboratory assays and laboratory support.	Statistical analysis details are documented in a formal statistical and analytical plan (SAP). \nPrimary efficacy endpoint: The null hypothesis (H0) is that the hazard ratio comparing apixaban versus aspirin for the primary endpoint will be 1.\nSecondary efficacy endpoint: The null hypothesis (H0) is that the hazard ratio comparing apixaban versus aspirin for the secondary endpoint will be 1.\nThe analysis datasets will include:\n•\tIntention-to-treat analysis dataset, which will include all randomized participants.\n•\tSafety analysis dataset, which will include all participants who took at least one dose of study drug.\n•\tPer-protocol analysis dataset, which will include all randomized participants who do not have an eligibility violation and who received at least one dose of study drug.\n\nEfficacy outcomes will be analyzed in the intention-to-treat analysis dataset. Safety outcomes will be analyzed in the safety analysis dataset.\nThe log-rank statistic will be used to test the null hypothesis that the hazard ratio is 1, comparing apixaban to aspirin, at a two-tailed alpha level of 0.05.\nA standard frequency table will be used to report the number (%) of SAEs, stratified by treatment group. \nLog-rank tests will be utilized to assess the treatment group differences in the rates of: (1) first symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage; (2) first major hemorrhage other than intracranial hemorrhage; and (3) death from any cause. \nThe ARCADIA investigators propose one interim analysis for efficacy (or harm) and futility to be performed when 1/2 of the expected events have occurred (75 events), with the details specified in the SAP.  \nThe primary efficacy and safety analyses will be stratified by age (<75 years versus ≥75 years), sex/gender, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white versus others). Differential effects of apixaban versus aspirin across these subgroups are not anticipated and therefore the trial is not powered specifically for these subgroup analyses, but these analyses will allow any unexpectedly large variations to be identified.\nThe SAP lists additional prespecified exploratory and sensitivity analyses, including analyses related to the secondary objective of the trial, which is to test the hypothesis that the relative efficacy of apixaban over aspirin increases with the severity of atrial cardiopathy.	The grant period began May 1, 2017; study site start-up and initiation began at that time. Our target is 120 sites. We anticipated consenting and screening for biomarkers 4 patients with unexplained stroke for every one patient that would be eligible for randomization (25% eligibility for randomization). Among the 155 patients consented and screened thus far, 66 (approximately 43%) have been eligible for randomization, and 45 have been randomized. There is a delay between determination of eligibility for randomization and randomization; patients must be randomized within 120 days of their stroke, but patients may have randomization delayed if the stroke is large, they are sent to rehabilitation, additional diagnostic testing is being performed, or for other reasons. \nAs of July 16, 2018 we have 101 sites that have executed their clinical trial agreements, 88 that have received central IRB approval, 83 that have received study drug, 75 that had had site readiness calls, and 74 that have been released to enroll participants. Of the 74 sites released to enroll, 44 have consented at least one patient for biomarker screening, and 30 have not consented any patients yet. Of those that have not consented anyone yet, 5 were released to enroll approximately 3 months ago, and 1 was released 4 months ago. Our contract states that sites that have not randomized any patients in a three month period will be placed on probation.\nWe have 5 VA sites participating as well; they have a different IRB approval process. Once they are approved centrally, we expect them to be and running fairly quickly. \nOur initial target for enrollment was 440 patients randomized per year X 2.5 years to achieve our full sample size of 1100. Site activation and recruitment per site has been slower than anticipated. At our present rate of about 4 sites released to enroll per week, we anticipate all 120 sites (another 46) to be up and running by November 1, 2018. Once all sites are active, we anticipate each one will consent 16 patients per year and randomize 4 per year; thus they should each be randomizing 0.33 patients per month. Our present rate among the 74 sites up and running is 0.25 patients per site per month, with a wide range from 0 to 2.0 patients per month. At our current rate it will take about 3.5 years to recruit, a full year longer than projected. Our recruitment goal is important both for power and for feasibility since we do not want study duration to extend too long as it requires patients to take medication for a long period and the medication is also costly.\nThe study protocol and a recruitment brochure are attached.
206	2017-09-11	55	\N	\N	Center for Identification and Study of Individuals with Atypical Diabetes Mellitus	Identifying rare atypical forms of diabetes	6	The purpose of the center is to bring together internationally recognized centers  (coupled with a wide national call for subjects) with expertise in the genetics and study of diabetes to: foster the study of individuals with rare atypical forms of diabetes mellitus; identify and analyze phenotypic and genotypic defects that may provide insights into more common, heterogeneous forms of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the general population; and develop a community resource to advance research in this area through the collection and dissemination of data and samples for access by the broad research community. The Central Hypothesis is that the identification and study of new cases of rare or atypical forms of diabetes, building on track record of the participating groups over the last three decades, will yield greater insight into the heterogeneity of more common forms of T2DM. This Center will support the following primary research endeavors: we will build on our existing monogenic diabetes resources, genetics expertise, and deep knowledge of diabetes to develop a process for identifying and studying individuals/families with rare and uncharacterized forms of diabetes; to adapt our existing redcap based monogenic diabetes database to create and manage a database, a living biobank and biospecimen repository of rare/atypical forms of diabetes for use by the broader research community in future analyses; to create a national network of collaborators to help identify and initially phenotype the individuals in pedigrees identified; and establish the ability to analyze the genetic variants using biobanked materials, the living biobank, and stored iPSCs. The general strategy is to promulgate a rubric for identification of atypical forms, filter out autoimmune and known monogenic forms and further characterize the remainder. Detailed genotyping and phenotyping of these individuals and their families in subsequent studies may help to characterize milder or otherwise atypical subtypes present in the spectrum of T2DM in the general population and reveal novel mechanistic pathways involved in the prevention and/or treatment of T2DM. The identification and study of new cases of rare or atypical forms of diabetes, building on track record of these groups over the last three decades, will yield greater insight into the heterogeneity of more common forms of T2DM.	The subjects will ascertained in five ways:\n1.\tThere could be 5 parallel ways to ascertain cases of rare diabetes:\na.\tInvestigator referral - clinicians at the various clinical sites\nb.\tSelf-referral - web-based process as John Buse outlined in his lengthy email\nc.\tNon-study physician referral - also web-based, open and publicized to endocrinologists in the community\nd.\tCapture via the electronic medical record in academic health center biobanks - for example: Vanderbilt BioVU, Partners Biobank, U of Chicago data warehouse, Mt. Sinai BioMe, Northwestern's NUGene, etc\ne.\tReferral from existing diabetes trials (DPP, Look AHEAD, GRADE, etc)\n\nOnce enrolled and consented, an expert working group will choose subjects recruited with high potential for rare atypical forms of diabetes. They will review the history, physical and laboratory data along with family history data and select subjects for call-back. Samples will then be collected for DNA, a small number of key lab tests, urine for c-peptide analysis, and consent for contacting them will be confirmed. Depending on family history, additional family members may also be enrolled. Genetic testing will include whole exome and genotyping (GWAS). Initial bioinformatics will determine a risk score for T1diabetes, and sequences for  20 or more known diabetes related genes will be analyzed. Samples will be sent for determining glucose, A1c, other standard lab tests, urine for c-peptide/creatinine ratio and several other tests. Results will again be reviewed by experts in diabetes and genetics. A subset of these subjects will be set aside for further phenotyping and/or whole genome sequencing. The results of these studies will be made available in "honest broker" deidentifed database for further studies by the research community upon application.	Specific Aims:\n(1)\tDevelop a strategy and process for identifying and enrolling individuals/families with rare/atypical forms of diabetes who can be recontacted and available for future research opportunities and collect clinical data and biospecimens. Outcome: identify up to 1000 high yield subjects per year\n(2)\tCharacterize key genes in the cohort and identify novel genes and mutations associated with new monogenic forms of diabetes and identify pre-symptomatic at risk members of the family. Outcome: new genes and their mutations that cause or strongly contribute to diabetes will be identified\n(3)\tCharacterize the cardinal features and phenotypic spectrum associated with new monogenic forms of diabetes and age related disease penetrance across mutation carriers in the registry. Outcome: Understand key features of newly forms of diabetes to lay the ground work for future studies\n(4)\tBuild and manage a database and biospecimen repository to store data and samples from individuals with rare/atypical forms of diabetes for future analyses. Outcome: A database will be created to directly accumulate data from the subjects; locate and describe the lab tests done and biological samples available; create the living biobank of subjects and their families as consent allows.\n(5)\tCreate a platform for a research match for the scientific community whereby researchers can access data, biospecimens, and/or recruit participants to participate in research studies and incorporate the results of these research studies into a rich, evolving research resource for the diabetes community. Outcome: Members of the diabetes and translational research community will be able to access the database of atypical diabetes subjects and request further information and biological samples for more detailed analysis or testing of targeted therapies	The primary outcome is the identification of subjects with heretofore unrecognized causes of diabetes.	1	Rare atypical diabetes is defined as non-autoimmune diabetes and non-cystic fibrosis diabetes and for this grant, non-known MODY (but will likely overlap) with features that experienced clinicians might recognize as unusual:\n1. Subjects with diabetes and a highly unusual presentation based on clinician's experience such as lean or nonobese, recurrent ketosis, non-progressive or rapidly progressive hyperglycemia.\n2. Lean GDM (autoimmune negative)\n3. Lean insulin resistant patients with diabetes that might include syndromes such as non-obese PCOS, lipodystrophy, and liver diabetes, as examples. \n5. Syndromic forms that are frequently associated with diabetes\n*Family history may be positive for diabetes but not always\n*Degree of obesity may vary and depends on ethnic group	The University of Chicago\nColumbia University \nHarvard University: Massachusetts General Hospital\nUniversity of Maryland \nUniversity of Michigan\nUNC\nVanderbilt University \nUCSF\nUniversity of Colorado\nWashington University St. Louis\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle	This is not an interventional study.	60 months	1 month	\N	We have consider various ways to do evaluate samples size needed:\n1. Have experienced clinicians in academic practices record the number of patients that say in a 1-2 week period whom they would consider atypical. \n2. Evaluate the number of subjects in an existing monogenic registry designed to identify subjects with MODY and monogenic diabetes who do not yet have a genetic diabetes to explain their diabetes. \n3. Use key search terms to search EHRs such as the BioVu at Vanderbilt to estimate the number of patients with diabetes who might have atypical features. \n\nFrom these estimates, it is possible that 5% of all potential subjects with diabetes might have atypical features. This is a large number- as many as 1-3 million people in the United States. However based on estimates of existing forms of monogenic diabetes, such as the percentage of people under age 45 with one of the more "common" forms of MODY, the total number of such known atypical forms in aggregate is estimated as between 200,000 - 1 million  - and this would be the composite of all the known genes. None of them by themselves would be much more than 200,000 individuals, such as in the case of glucokinase mutations. This suggests that the effort to recruit as many as 500-1000 highly selected subjects per year is likely to yield some modest number of atypical forms.	\N
201	2017-08-22	5	\N	\N	ToRsemide compArisoN with furoSemide FOR Management of Heart Failure	TRANSFORM-HF	4	TRANSFORM-HF is a large-scale, pragmatic, randomized, unblinded clinical effectiveness study comparing torsemide versus furosemide as treatment for heart failure. Approximately 6,000 participants with heart failure will be enrolled. The primary objective of the TRANSFORM-HF study is to compare the treatment strategy of torsemide versus furosemide on clinical outcomes over 12 months in patients with heart failure who are hospitalized. \nWe will implement education and quality initiatives to foster efficient, ethical, cost-conscious trial conduct with rapid enrollment and will ensure adequate screening and randomization of traditionally underrepresented racial, ethnic, and gender groups	•\tThis study will be a randomized, unblinded, two-arm, multi-center clinical trial of patients with heart failure who are hospitalized. Heart failure need not be the reason for hospitalization. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either oral torsemide OR oral furosemide prior to hospital discharge. Oral dosing of torsemide compared to furosemide will be\n1mg:2mg. The specific loop diuretic dose will be at the discretion of the treating physician with the above noted conversion.\n•\tTrial enrollment can occur at any time before hospital discharge, at the discretion of the healthcare provider.\n•\tPatients will receive the randomized medication during the remainder of their hospitalization and will continue on with randomized therapy post-discharge, and will receive follow-up per standard care without any additional study-specific visits.\n•\tPatients will have 30-day, 6-month and 12-month follow-up phone contacts for assessments of vital status, interval hospitalizations, adherence, and quality of life.	Our primary hypothesis is that torsemide will reduce all-cause mortality by a relative 15% compared to furosemide over a follow-up period of 12 months. \nOther secondary objectives of this protocol will be to examine the effect of torsemide versus furosemide for the following endpoints:\na.\tAll-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization over 12 months\nb.\tTotal hospitalizations over 12 months\nc.\tAll-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization over 30 days\nd.\tHealth-related quality of life over 12 months, as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire	Primary Endpoint \nThe primary endpoint of this study will be all-cause mortality at 12 months. Patients will receive a call from the DCRI Call Center at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after randomization to document vital status. The NDI will be queried yearly and at study closeout.  \n\nSecondary Endpoints\n•\tAll-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization over 12 months:\no\tPatients will be contacted by the DCRI Call Center to document vital status, medication adherence, and to capture hospitalization information.

Furthermore, these sites will be chosen based on their ability to support robust enrollment of women and minorities. Each site will enroll ~120 patients over 36 months (~3 patients per site per month).	This will be an unblinded, randomized clinical trial comparing:\n•\tOral torsemide (furosemide-equivalent dose)\n•\tOral furosemide\n\nFor patients receiving loop diuretics other than furosemide, conversion to furosemide equivalents will be as follows: \n1 mg oral torsemide = 2 mg oral furosemide \n1 mg oral or intravenous bumetanide = 40 mg oral furosemide \nPatients will receive the randomized medication during the remainder of their hospitalization with continuation of the randomized therapy post-discharge. Post-discharge dose adjustments will be at the discretion of the treating physician(s) with strategies in place to maintain adherence (if possible) to the randomized medication.	Enrollment will be approximately 36 months.	Each patient's participation will occur from randomization during hospitalization to 12 months post-randomization	None.	The primary analysis will be based on intention-to-treat. Crossovers will be tracked by the call center at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months and we will have an alternate analysis cohort based on these data. \nThe statistical comparison of the two randomized arms with respect to the primary endpoint will be a time-to-event analysis, and therefore will be based on the time from randomization to mortality. The Cox proportional hazards regression model will be the primary tool to analyze and assess outcome differences between the two treatment arms. A hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for summarizing the difference in outcomes between the two treatment arms will be computed using the Cox model. \nSample Size- \nBased on previous data in similar populations, we anticipate a 20% mortality rate in the furosemide group at 12-months following randomization. A sample size of 6000 subjects will provide approximately 85% power to detect a 15% relative reduction in the primary endpoint with torsemide (3% absolute difference). This sample size will also provide excellent power for the secondary endpoints. \nAnalysis of Secondary Endpoints- \nThe analyses for the time-to-event secondary endpoints will be similar to those outlined for the primary endpoint using the time from randomization through the first occurrence of any component of a specific secondary endpoint (or censoring) as the response variable, and assessing group differences using the Cox proportional hazards model.	First site initiation date is projected in mid-Feb, 2018. First patient enrolled is projected in mid-March, 2018.

243	2017-12-01	40	\N	\N	A Phase IV, Randomized, Double Blind Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Apixaban in Subjects with Calf Vein Thrombosis	Golden Calf Trial	5	Management of calf vein thrombosis (cDVT) is not well defined.  The guideline preference for serial ultrasound surveillance over anticoagulation is based on expert opinion only.  The primary objective of this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is to evaluate whether a strategy of anticoagulation with apixaban is more effective than serial ultrasound in the management of cDVT for the prevention of thrombus propagation, embolization, or recurrence.  We hypothesize that apixaban 5 mg twice daily is associated with a significantly lower rate of venous thromboembolic events compared to matched placebo in patients with cDVT.  Trial funding is through the competitive, peer-reviewed ARISTA-USA program.	The proposed study is a phase IV, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial to evaluate whether a strategy of anticoagulation with apixaban is more effective than serial ultrasound surveillance in the management of patients with calf DVT for the prevention of thrombus propagation, embolization or venous thrombosis recurrence.  For the two study arms, 250 patients will be assigned to receive either apixaban or matching placebo for 3 months.  Subjects will undergo serial ultrasound imaging for assessment of thrombus propagation at 7, 14 and 90 days.	The primary objective is to evaluate whether a strategy of active anticoagulation with apixaban is more effective than serial ultrasound imaging in the management of patients with isolated calf vein thrombosis (DVT) for the prevention of thrombus propagation, pulmonary embolism and recurrent venous thromboembolic events.  The principal safety outcome is to assess the combination of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding for subjects randomized to apixaban vs. placebo control.  There will be two secondary objectives.  The first is to evaluate whether apixaban is more effective than placebo for the prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome at one year as assessed by the Villalta score.   The second is to determine the timing of thrombus propagation.  The current understanding of thrombus propagation is that if it occurs, it will occur within the first 2 weeks of diagnosis.  This concept of timing of thrombus propagation is the basis for current guideline endorsed approach which limits the requirement for repeated ultrasound up to 2 weeks only.  Yet, this guideline recommendation has not been validated.  Our study is poised to verify this assumption.	The primary efficacy endpoint of this study will be thrombus propagation either within the calf veins or into proximal deep veins (popliteal, femoral or iliac veins), symptomatic or incidental VTE recurrence by day 90: \n1.\tThrombus propagation:  The original calf DVT must be confirmed by either duplex ultrasonography, venography, CT, or MRI.  All patients will then undergo serial ultrasound imaging at 7, 14 and 90 days.  Propagation is defined by two criteria: (1) when a thrombus previously confined to the calf veins is found to extend into a proximal vein including popliteal, femoral or iliac veins of the ipsilateral limb or (2) if the thrombus extends but remains confined to the calf veins. The thrombus propagation must be confirmed by comparing the new imaging with previous imaging clearly showing extension into a proximal vein not seen on the original imaging study.  Thrombus propagation that remains confined to the calf veins must extend beyond 5 cm of the previous thrombus length, extend into a new venous segment (upper, mid, or lower), or involve a new vein (not previously involved) within the calf.  \n2.\tRecurrent DVT:  A recurrent DVT must be distinguished from the original thrombus by comparing serial imaging modalities.  In order to be classified as a recurrent event, there must be new filling defects evident on the second study not appreciated on the original images or an interval study clearly showing thrombus resolution.   \n3.\tPE: Symptomatic pulmonary emboli must be confirmed by either CT, MR or conventional pulmonary angiography or VQ perfusion imaging.    \n4.\tFatal PE:  PE based on objective diagnostic testing, autopsy, or death which cannot be attributed to a documented cause and for which PE/DVT cannot be ruled out (unexplained death).\n5.\tIncidental VTE recurrence:  It is anticipated that recurrent venous thrombosis or thrombus propagation may be identified incidentally.  In order to be classified as an event, the thrombus in question must be confirmed by cross sectional imaging.    \nThe primary safety endpoints will include any episode of major bleeding including fatal bleeding or any episode of clinically relevant non-major bleeding:\n1.\tMajor bleeding: Major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding plus a hemoglobin decrease of ≥ 2 g/dL or transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells, or intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, pericardial or fatal bleeding.  \n2.\tClinically relevant non-major bleeding: Clinically relevant non-major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but associated with medical intervention, an unscheduled contact with a member of the health care team, or temporary cessation of study treatment.\nThe first secondary endpoint will include as assessment of the post-thrombotic syndrome as assessed by the Villalta score at one year time point from the time of the original ultrasound confirmed diagnosis.  \nThe second secondary endpoint will be to establish the timing of thrombus propagation for those individuals who have suffered such an event.  The date of thrombus propagation confirmation will be compared to the date of the original DVT diagnosis for this purpose.	1	Inclusion criteria will include both genders, ages 18 to 99 years, with confirmed acute calf vein thrombosis and able to provide written informed consent.  Exclusion criteria will include subjects under age 18, those who have received more than 72 hours of anticoagulant therapy or have a contraindication to anticoagulants.  Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 ml/min, severe liver disease, severe thrombocytopenia, short life expectancy, active bleeding or active cancer will be excluded.  Because of drug interactions and metabolism alterations, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP 3A4 inducers will not be allowed.	We are anticipating three participating sites, each with a vascular center platform.  The involvement of sites with such a platform will ensure that expertise in vascular imaging is available for establishing the original diagnosis and providing accurate follow up imaging assessment during the proposed follow up intervals.  For example, the Mayo Clinic Gonda Vascular Center is a multidisciplinary practice involving 49 physicians from disciplines including vascular surgery, vascular medicine, vascular radiology, cardiology, hematology, physiatry, rheumatology, dermatology, general internal medicine and podiatry. This practice is currently supported by 112 allied health personnel.  In 2016, there were 30,076 patient visits to the Gonda Vascular Center for the evaluation and treatment of a vast variety of vascular diseases.  \t\nThe Thrombophilia Clinic began seeing patients in January 1997 with the goals of providing comprehensive care for the patient with an acquired or familial thrombophilia, and performing translational research and graduate medical education in thrombosis and thrombophilia.  Major aims of the Clinic include acute outpatient management of DVT/PE, peri-procedure management of the chronically anticoagulated patient, assessment and recommendations for patients at high risk for postoperative VTE, and consultation for patients with suspected familial or acquired thrombophilia.  In addition the Center provides a chronic anticoagulation clinic with point-of-care testing.  The Center is located on the fourth floor of the Gonda Building and within the Gonda Vascular Center.  A multidisciplinary group of nine consultants staffs the Center, including specialists in Cardiovascular Diseases, Hematology/Oncology, and General Internal Medicine.  A nurse practitioner supervisor, two physician assistants, 4 advanced practice nurses and five registered nurses provide direct patient care for acute and chronic outpatient anticoagulation management services. Over 1,500 patients with a familial or acquired thrombophilia have been seen since the inception of the Thrombophilia Center, and the Center had over 31,000 patient visits in 2016 alone. \nA major advantage of the Thrombophilia Clinic is the centralized location within the Gonda Vascular Center.  Adjacent to the Clinic is the Vascular Utrasound practice.  This practice includes 10 ultrasound rooms with 10 FTE sonographers and 2 FTE vascular radiologists.  This busy practice performs between 60 and 80 vascular examinations each day including venous ultrasound for the rapid diagnosis of acute DVT.  Once a patient is found to have an acute DVT, an immediate call is sent to the Thrombophilia team who provide rapid patient triage and prompt evaluation and treatment with anticoagulation initiation.  This system of prompt assessment and anticoagulation implementation has reduced referrals to the emergency department by over 90% for this purpose and has greatly improved the time to treatment of these patients.  Beyond providing prompt and efficient care for these patients, this system maximizes patient identification for randomization into clinical trials such as this.	Patients randomized to oral apixaban will be treated with 10 mg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily for 3 months.  Patients assigned to oral matching placebo will take their tablets in a similar fashion.	Study duration will be 36 months.  Upon completion of subject recruitment and 12 month follow up, data analysis will be completed within 6 months.	Subject participation will be 12 months.  At the time of the initial assessment, the complete history and physical examination performed by the health care provider attending the patient will be recorded by the enrolling study personnel.  Recent baseline laboratory data will include complete blood counts (CBC), creatinine, and ALT (or AST).  The creatinine clearance will be calculated using the method of Cockcroft and Gault.  Following randomization, subjects will be assigned to either active treatment with apixaban or placebo control.  Each subject will then undergo follow up ultrasound imaging at 7 days (+/- 2 days), 14 days (+/- 2 days) and 90 days (+/- 7 days).  This ultrasound imaging study will focus on venous thrombus propagation into the proximal venous segments.  At each follow up, all venous segments of the involved lower extremity will be imaged.  This imaging should be performed at a site participating in this research project.   Patients will be called at Days 30 & 60 (+/- 7 days) to check their health status, adverse reactions and medications.   \nPatients will be instructed to report to the clinic immediately if they had any bleeding or symptoms of recurrent deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both. All suspected episodes of recurrent thrombosis will be investigated with the use of objective tests, according to prespecified diagnostic algorithms.  At 3 months (+/- 7 days), patients will return for a routine clinically indicated ultrasound and clinical assessment.  \nAt 12 months (+/- 30 days), each patient will have a brief clinical evaluation.  This will include an assessment of bleeding or thromboembolic outcomes occurring after active study completion.  The Villalta survey will provide an assessment of the post-phlebitic syndrome.	\N	All patients who received at least one dose of apixaban 5 mg or matching placebo control will be included in the primary analysis under intention to treat.  The analysis of venous thromboembolic endpoint will primarily focus on those events which occurred during treatment. \n\nFrequency of the primary endpoint will be tabulated by treatment arm without regard to the time the event was observed. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be used to compare the event rates by treatment group stratified by clinical site. The pooled estimate of the odds ratio will be used as the primary measure of association for the study.  \n\nIn the event the primary outcome measure is not available on all participants, worst case imputation (i.e., assuming the missing participants were events) will be used. \n\nAn exploratory analysis will investigate the time to event is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of a VTE event, death, or an adverse event that results in termination of treatment (including vascular events).  Patients who were lost to follow-up, who withdrew informed consent before the end of the predefined study duration will be censored at the last day the patient had a complete assessment for study outcomes within the intended study period in this analysis. The incidence curves of VTE events will be plotted.  The incidence of VTE events will be summarized as a combined endpoint and separate endpoints by treatment arm.  The difference in the incidences of the combined endpoint at 3 months between treatment arms will be estimated and tested using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution. \n  \nEvents observed 7 days after the end of treatment but before 30 days from end of treatment will be described.\nAll patients who received at least one dose of study medication will be included in the secondary safety analysis. The analysis of major bleeding plus clinically relevant non-major bleeding events will primarily focus on those events which occurred during treatment or within 7 days of treatment discontinuation. Major bleeding events observed later will be described separately.  \n\nFrequency of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding will be tabulated by treatment arm.  The incidence of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding will be summarized as a combined endpoint and separate endpoints by treatment arm.  The difference in the incidences of the combined endpoint at 3 months between treatment arms will be estimated and tested using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution. All tests will be conducted at the one-sided 0.05 significance level.	A total of 250 subjects will be enrolled over a 2 year period for this study.  Enrollment will occur at 3 sites.  We anticipate that a sizable percentage of patients will be recruited from Mayo Clinic Rochester.  Patients will also be recruited from Mayo Clinic Eau Claire and Mayo Clinic La Crosse.  Both hospital in-patients and patients referred to the Thrombophilia Clinic for anticoagulation initiation will be recruited.  We have developed an electronic system of subject capture which uses a natural language processor technology to identify all subjects with acute DVT at our organization.  The tool scans all inpatient and outpatient records including radiology reports using search terms synonymous with venous thrombosis.  Generated lists are then sent at 4:00 AM daily to our study personnel for review.  Clinical records are then reviewed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Eligible subjects are then contacted for study participation.
472	2019-02-28	20	\N	t	A randomized trial of CT fluoroscopy-guided targeted autologous blood and fibrin glue patching for treatment of cerebrospinal fluid leaks in spontaneous intracranial hypotension.	The PATCH Trial	6	The goal of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the efficacy of CT fluoroscopy-guided targeted epidural patching for treatment of imaging-confirmed spinal CSF leaks to that of a simulated procedure without patching material in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension.	This study will employ a multi-center, parallel, randomized, blinded, prospective, crossover design. Enrolled patients will be assigned to one of two treatment arms using a block randomization scheme: CT fluoroscopy-guided blood and fibrin glue patching targeted to the site of CSF leak or a simulated procedure without patching material. Baseline data will be collected including: (a) symptom profile and duration, (b) headache impact test (HIT-6), (c) EQ-5D (a measure of overall health status), (d) work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), and (e) medication usage (see Outcomes). All procedures will be performed under CT fluoroscopy in the same scanner (see Resources). The location of injection for patients in both arms will be targeted to the site of the CSF leak identified on prior imaging (e.g., CT or dynamic myelogram).	SPECIFIC AIM 1: Compare the efficacy of CT fluoroscopy-guided targeted blood and fibrin glue patching (treatment arm) to that of a simulated procedure without patching material (control arm) in the treatment of patients with SIH and imaging-confirmed CSF leaks\nSPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine if EBP reduces migraine and opioid medication use in SIH patients.\nSPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine the rate of resolution of classic SIH brain MRI findings at 2 months in each arm.	1.1 Compare the difference in the primary outcome measure (HIT-6 score, a validated headache intensity metric, at one month) between the two patient groups.\n1.2 Compare the difference in secondary outcome measures between the two patient groups: HIT-6 at 2 weeks and 4 months; EQ-5D, patient global impression of change (PGIC), work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), and Duke headache questionnaire (a form capturing SIH symptom information) at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 4 months.\n\n2.1 Compare the change in the number of opioid and migraine headache prescriptions as well as the change in dosages at one month from baseline between the two groups.  \n\n3.1 Determine the resolution rate of pachymeningeal enhancement, the venous distension sign, and brain sagging for each group at 2 months.\n\nPatient Outcome Measures and Crossover\nHeadache Impact Test (HIT-6): A validated headache assessment tool with good internal consistency and test-retest reliability that is designed to provide a global measure of headache impact in six domains [32]. Scores range from 36 (asymptomatic) to 78 (severe headache). Score ranges: 36-49 (little or no headache impact), 50-55 (some impact), 56-59 (substantial impact), and >60 (severe impact) [33, 34]. Prior studies have determined that the minimally important clinical difference between groups is 1.5 points for the HIT-6 [35].\n\nEQ-5D: A standardized measure of health status that provides a simple, generic measure of health for clinical appraisal [36]. It is well-validated for health status measurement [37] and for quality-of-life in headache [34].\n\nPatient Global Impression of Change (PGIC): A validated 7-point Likert-type scale assessing a patient's overall impression of improvement after intervention [38, 39].\n\nWork Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): A validated instrument with good test-retest reliability used extensively in health research [40, 41] that quantifies impairment in daily activities and work productivity [42].\n\nCrossover: Patients will be permitted to crossover to the other treatment arm two months after the procedure.	1	Inclusion Criteria: Adult patients meeting International Classification of Headache\nDisorders 3rd Edition (ICHD-3) criteria for a diagnosis of SIH (Table 1) who have had a\ncontrast-enhanced brain MRI and a myelogram confirming the presence of a CSF leak.\n\nExclusion Criteria: (a) recent (i.e., < 2 weeks) blood patch, (b) contraindication\nor inability to undergo the procedure, (c) inability to provide informed consent, (d) expected inability to complete follow-up assessment, (e) a contraindication to receiving contrast material (precluding an epidurogram), or (f) contraindication to receiving fibrin glue (i.e., allergy).	tbd	CT Fluoroscopy-Guided Blood and Fibrin Glue Patching \nPatients in both arms of the study will be placed prone on the CT gantry table. Intravenous (IV) access will be obtained and sterile autologous blood will be acquired for the purposes of possible patching. A planning CT scan (120 kVp, automatic tube current modulation: 100 - 400 mA, 2.5 mm section thickness, gantry rotation time 0.5 seconds) will be obtained with z-axis limited to the area of interest. Acquired images will be used to plan a needle trajectory and approach to the location of the CSF leak for targeted patching using previously described techniques for CT fluoroscopy-guided epidural patching (e.g. a lateral approach trajectory\nto the neuroforaminal epidural space, an oblique interlaminar trajectory to the dorsal spinal canal epidural space, or an approach traversing the neuroforamen to reach the ventral epidural space) [14, 26-29]. The skin surface will then be marked, sterilized, draped, and anesthetized with 2% lidocaine. At this point, a computer generated randomized treatment assignment will be delivered to the treating physician in an opaque sealed envelope, which will determine if the patient is treated with targeted blood and fibrin glue patching versus the simulated procedure. Patients and outcome assessors will remained blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the study. The treating physicians are unable to be blinded, as they will be aware of the type of patching material used. The effectiveness of patient blinding will be assessed using the Bang Blinding Index prior to discharge on the day of the procedure [30].\nTargeted Patching of CSF Leaks with Blood and Fibrin Glue (Experimental Arm)\nFor patients randomized to targeted patching with blood and fibrin glue, a 22-gauge 3.5 or 5 inch Quincke tip spinal needle will be advanced under intermittent CT fluoroscopic-guidance to the epidural space at the target location. On reaching the target, gentle aspiration will confirm absence of blood return. Approximately 0.2 mL of contrast material (iopamidol 200 mgI/mL; Isovue-M 200, Bracco Diagnostics Inc., Princeton, NJ) will then be injected to assess needle tip position and potential future spread of patching material. Intravascular injection will be excluded using a "double-tap" technique (i.e., 2 sets of CT fluoroscopic images: an initial image immediately after injection and a second image acquired 2-3 seconds later to assess for contrast material washout), as previously described [31]. After visual confirmation of correct needle tip position, a mixture of autologous blood (~1 mL) and fibrin glue (~1-3 mL) will be slowly injected. This process will be repeated for all planned needle placements. The number of needle placements and total volume of blood and fibrin glue will be at the discretion of the treating radiologist, but will be based upon: (a) the extent of spread of patching material, (b) mass effect on the thecal sac and neural structures, and (c) patient symptoms. On completion of the procedure, the patient will be observed for 2 hours in the radiology post-procedural unit.\n\nSimulated Patching Procedure (Control Arm)\nPatients randomized to undergo the simulated patching procedure will have the same experience as the patients in the experimental arm, as described above. This includes placement of an IV, acquisition of sterile blood for potential autologous patching (which will be discarded rather than used), a planning CT, all of the same needle placements that would have been performed if the patient were randomized to the experimental arm, and contrast injection for the epidurogram. However, instead of injection of blood and fibrin glue patching material through the needles, an equivalent volume of preservative free sterile saline will be\ninjected (buffered intrathecal electrolyte/dextrose injection; Elliots B Solution, Lukare Medical, Scotch Plains, NJ). On completion of the procedure, the patient will be observed for 2 hours in the post-procedural unit.	5 years	4 months	\N	Statistics\nPatient Outcome Analysis\nA reduction in HIT-6 from a pre-procedural score of > 56 (substantial or severe impact on life) to < 49 (little to no impact on life) will be considered a positive response. Primary Endpoint (HIT-6 at 1 month): We will apply a two-sample test for proportions to test the primary endpoint. Secondary Endpoints: Analysis will employ a test for difference in binomial proportions or a t-test for binomial or semi-continuous variables.\n\nSample Size Determination\nBased on previously acquired prospective outcomes data (unpublished), we will conservatively estimate a positive response rate of 50% in our experimental arm (see Preliminary Studies). In a meta-analysis examining sham procedures, our group found a maximum placebo response of 30% (Gu AP, unpublished). Therefore, to obtain a power of 0.8 (alpha 0.05) to detect superiority of the blood and fibrin glue patching group, assuming positive response rates of 50% for the patching group and 30% for the control group, we would need a total of 148 patients (74 patients in each arm).\n\nInterim Data Analysis\nAn interim analysis will be performed of the first 74 patients by the biostatistician. All study participants and other personnel will remain blinded. Safety and efficacy will be evaluated using an O'Brien-Fleming stopping rule of p < 0.001 in order to evaluate for early evidence of treatment efficacy [43].\n\nCrossover, Withdrawal, or Missing Data\nWe will employ an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis for this trial [44]. Patients that crossover between study arms, withdraw from the study, or for whom there is missing data will all be handled in the same manner: we will conservatively assume that no further benefit will be gained from the initial treatment. As such, the most recent available outcomes data will be extrapolated to all later time points for which no data are available.	to be determined
69	2016-12-07	70	\N	\N	MyGeneRank: Empowering Individuals with a Mobile App for the Genetic Risk of Coronary Artery Disease	CAD Study	\N	The primary objective of this study is to provide coronary artery disease genetic risk information to patients in an easy to obtain manner (a smartphone application) so that it can be utilized in behavioral or therapeutic decision making by patients in conjunction with their physicians. It has been previously demonstrated that individuals with high coronary artery disease genetic risk benefit most from initiation of statin therapy, whereas individuals of low genetic risk appear to benefit only marginally from statin therapy (Mega et al. Lancet, 2015). While this information has been demonstrated to be clinically useful, there is no manner in which patients or physicians can obtain this information. Thus, we have developed a smartphone application that computes this score automatically by utilizing pre-existing genetic data, and aim to provide this information in an easy to obtain manner in order to determine if and how this information is used in clinical or behavioral decision making.	Study subjects will be able to participate via Apple ResearchKit. Study consent will be obtained online via the smartphone application. Upon consent, genetic data will be transmitted to STSI servers via the 23andMe API (https://api.23andme.com/) triggered via the smartphone application. Health and demographic data will also be transmitted to STSI servers via pre and 6-months post-test surveys administered via the smartphone application. Results of genetic risk calculations will be transmitted directly back to study participants via these access points. All genetic, health, and demographic data collected will be stored on secure local STSI servers in a HIPAA compliant manner.	The primary aim of the study is to determine the influence of coronary artery disease genetic risk score information on statin use. Statin use will be determined via self-report, through a survey administered via the smartphone application at the time the genetic risk score is generated and 6-months post receipt of the genetic risk score.     The secondary aim of the study is to determine the influence of coronary artery disease genetic risk score information on other behaviors (smoking, exercise, and changes in weight and blood pressure). These measures will also be determined via the smartphone application at the time the genetic risk score is generated and 6-months post receipt of the genetic risk score.	Self-reported changes to statin use or initiation of preventative behaviors 6-months after receiving a coronary artery disease genetic risk score. Survey questions include: change in use of statins, change in use of other cholesterol medications, change in use of blood pressure medications, change in weight, height, cholesterol, and blood pressure measures, change in diagnosis status for diabetes and coronary artery disease, smoking behavior, and physical activity measures.	\N	Study participants must have pre-existing 23andMe genetic profiling data and must have access to an Apple Smartphone or Tablet to access the genetic risk score application via the Apple Research Kit.	Not provided	MyGeneRank is designed to provide any individual their genetic risk for disease without requiring familiarity in genetic data analysis or data handling. This application interfaces with the 23andMe application program interface (API) to directly transfer a user's data to our secure servers. A series of computations are then performed on our servers and the user's estimated genetic risk is returned to them via graphical interface on the smartphone app. The genetic risk score is calculated using a weighted allele-counting approach, similar to that performed in prior studies (Mega et al. Lancet 2015). Markers and weights were selected based on results from the most current coronary artery disease GWAS meta-analysis, which identified 57 markers associated with coronary artery disease at the genome-wide level. Because all of these markers are not typically present on a genotyping array, imputation of these missing markers is performed. Haplotypes are first estimated by pre-phasing a user's genetic data against the 1000 Genomes reference panel using SHAPEIT then imputed genotypes including a 5 Mb region around each marker are calculated using IMPUTE2. The estimated contribution to disease risk from an imputed marker is calculated by treating the genotype probabilities as dosages. The resulting GRS is then compared to a population reference panel, and the resulting percentile rank of genetic risk relative to this population is returned to the user on the app. A pre and 6 months post score survey is administered via the smartphone application to determine whether therapeutic or preventative behaviors are influenced by the genetic risk score.	Not provided	Not provided	None.	Simple contingency table based tests will be utilized to determine whether placement in high (>80th percentile), intermediate (20-80 percentile), or low (<20th percentile) genetic risk for coronary artery disease influences therapeutic and behavioral endpoints.	A publication describing the need and utility of coronary artery disease genetic risk scores, and the availability of our smartphone application will be published in a peer reviewed journal. Following publication, social media and press will be utilized to increase awareness of the existence of the MyGeneRank application. Potential participants will be self-referred based on these advertisements. 23andMe has over 1 million customers, we expect to capture a small proportion of those customers, resulting in a projection of 10,000 subjects. We expect that the vast majority of subjects will enroll very soon after our publication and social media campaign. The subject accrual period will be open indefinitely, though we expect to freeze and analyze data within 1 year of launch of the application. The primary challenge we would like to address through the Trial Innovation Network is a Participant Engagement Studio to collaborate with stakeholders/potential participants in evaluating the research kit app and maintaining engagement through study completion. The MyGeneRank application has been finalized and test access will be provided to the Trial Innovation Network if this proposal is accepted.
323	2018-07-20	5	\N	t	The Impact of Low Flow Oxygen Therapy on Hospital Admissions and Mortality in Patients with\nHeart Failure and Central Sleep Apnea	LOFT-HF	4	LOFT-HF is a large, pragmatic, multi-site randomized control outcomes trial evaluating the effect of Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy (NOXT) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and Central Sleep Apnea (CSA).  The LOFT-HF trial will compare sleep education and current guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to continuous use of NOXT in addition to GDMT in HFrEF patients with CSA.  Heart failure outcomes including hospital admissions, mortality, quality of life, and exercise capacity will be monitored for study participants over the duration of study (anticipated to average 2.5 years in average patient follow-up).	LOFT-HF is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled outcomes trial with parallel group design, with patients randomized to either control (optimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure plus sham nocturnal oxygen therapy (NOXT)) or active treatment (optimal GDMT plus NOXT) in a 1:1 ratio.	PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\nThe primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the long-term effects of NOXT on the mortality and morbidity of patients with stable HFrEF, already receiving optimal GDMT, who have CSA. \n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\nThe secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of NOXT on disease-specific mortality; cardiovascular events; exercise capacity; patient-reported outcomes (disease-specific and generic quality of life); and functional status.

112	2017-02-10	3	\N	\N	Volume Expansion in Children with Shiga Toxin-Producing E. coli Infection to Prevent or Mitigate Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome: a Multinational Randomized Clinical Trial	Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Study	\N	Our overall objective is to determine if hospitalization and intravascular volume expansion prior to development of the Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) improve outcomes in Shiga Toxin Producing E. coli (STEC) infected children when compared with the current standard of care: outpatient expectant management.               Our hypotheses are that in STEC-infected children, inpatient intravascular volume expansion will be associated with a clinically-important decrease in the proportion of children who develop HUS and with with reductions in the frequencies of  A) Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Stage 2 or 3 creatinine based acute kidney injury, B) performance of important medical procedures (i.e. renal replacement therapy (RRT), transfusion, intubation, intensive care unit admission, plasmapheresis), and C) important medical complications (i.e. seizure, stroke, coma, pancreatitis, death) when compared with outpatient expectant management.	We will conduct a randomized, controlled, unblinded, multi-center, multi-national trial of children aged 6 months to 18 years with STEC infection. Children will be randomized to 1) hospitalization and administration of intravascular volume expansion, or 2) outpatient observation and expectant management.      We attempt to avoid bias by using laboratory based outcomes (including proimary outcome) measured at similar time points in both groups, or outcomes based on major invasive medical interventions.	Specific Aim 1. Determine if inpatient intravascular volume expansion in STEC-infected children prior to the development of HUS decreases the proportion of children who develop HUS when compared to outpatient expectant management.

A full statistical plan will be developed as part of trial planning activities               The primary outcome is the dichotomous outcome measure of HUS, analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle. As a secondary analysis, we will compare study arms on several outcomes [Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Stage 2 or 3 creatinine based acute kidney injury (AKI), important medical procedures [i.e. RRT, transfusion, intubation, intensive care unit admission, plasmapheresis] and complications (i.e. seizure, stroke, coma, pancreatitis, death)] adjusting for the covariates age, sex, STEC strain, day of illness, baseline creatinine, and hospital. Chronic renal disease will be evaluated at 1, 6 and 12-months. To compare persistence of chronic renal disease at various time points we will use contingency table analysis. We will use the log-rank test to compare the chronic renal disease curves of the two groups and we will construct Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for covariates and for clustering at the hospital level. We will analyze specified adverse events using contingency table methods similar to the chronic renal disease analysis. For contiguous episodes of the same event within a patient, we will only use the first occurrence. Non-contiguous or non-associated events of the same type will be treated as separate events; hence, the adverse event analysis will be based on non-associated events as the unit of observation	The enrollment plan will be developed during the trial planning period.
213	2017-10-11	31	\N	\N	TRaditional vs. Early Aggressive Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis	TREAT-MS (PILOT)	4	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of neurological disability that affects individuals in the prime of life. There are several medications that reduce early relapses (caused by autoimmune attacks on myelin coating in the central nervous system),  but  whether long-term disability (due to accumulating axonal injury) can be prevented, in particular by higher-efficacy and first-line therapies alike, is unclear. The primary aim of this pragmatic, randomized controlled trial is to evaluate, jointly and independently among patients deemed at higher risk vs. lower risk for disability accumulation, whether an "early aggressive" therapy approach, versus starting with a traditional therapy, influences the intermediate-term risk of disability accumulation. Several sub-aims are embedded within the design of the trial.	This is a multicenter, phase 3, pragmatic, rater-blinded, randomized controlled trial of 900 people with MS. Participants will be categorized as at lower- vs. higher-risk of longer-term disability and will be randomized 1:1, stratified by this risk, to higher-efficacy vs. first-line therapies. We will evaluate if there is a benefit to higher-efficacy therapy and whether that benefit differs based on baseline disability risk.\n \nAdditionally, those at low risk of disability who have breakthrough on first-line therapy will be re-randomized to higher-efficacy therapy or to a different first-line therapy. Subsequent breakthrough will lead to switching to a medication of their choice.	Aim 1. To evaluate, overall and independently among patients deemed at higher risk vs. lower risk for disability accumulation, whether an "early aggressive" therapy approach, versus starting with a lower-efficacy therapy, influences the intermediate-term risk of disability accumulation on exam.\n\nSub-aim 1: To evaluate the impact of early aggressive therapy on cognition and patient-reported outcomes such as fatigue and health-related quality of life as well as on imaging metrics of neurodegeneration.\n\nAim 2. To evaluate if, among patients deemed at lower risk for disability accumulation who start on first-line MS therapies but experience breakthrough disease, those who switch to a higher-efficacy therapy versus a new first-line therapy have different intermediate-term risk of disability accumulation on exam.\n\nSub-aim 2: To evaluate the impact of switching from first-line to a higher-efficacy vs. to other first-line therapy on cognition, patient-reported outcomes (e.g. fatigue, quality of life) and imaging metrics of neurodegeneration.	The primary endpoint is sustained disability progression, as measured by the EDSS-plus. The EDSS plus is a composite measure that incorporates the traditional EDSS step score with changes in two components of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), namely the timed 25-foot walk test and the 9-hole peg test. \n\nSecondary and tertiary outcomes will include the Patient-Determined Disease Steps, the MSFC total z-score, relapse recovery, cognition (Symbol Digit Modalities Test), the MS Impact Scale, Neuro-QoL, social status metrics, safety/adverse events, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of atrophy, number of new relapses or brain lesions, thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer, and number of new medications/escalated doses/other prescribed interventions for MS-related symptom management.	1	The eligibility criteria are broad, consistent with the pragmatic nature of the trial. Participants will meet current criteria for relapsing-remitting MS and will be aged 18-60 years. Patients must be eligible for at least one higher-efficacy medication, have no chemotherapy in past year, and have only limited previous exposure (if any at all) to prior MS therapy.	We anticipate 40 actively enrolling sites. 38 sites so far have agreed to participate: Johns Hopkins, University of Alabama, University of Florida, University of Kansas, University of Louisville, University of Michigan, University of Pittsburgh, University of Rochester, University of South Florida, University of Texas Southwestern, University of Vermont, University of Washington, Cedars-Sinai, Central Texas Neurology Consultants, Christiana Care Neuroscience, Columbia University, Dignity Health, Duke University, Georgetown University, Hackensack University Medical Center, Holy Name MS Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mayo Clinic, Mt. Sinai Health System, Mt. Carmel Health System, Neurology Specialists of Tidewater, Norton Neurology Services, New York University, Ohio State University, Oregon Health and Sciences University, Providence Health, Rush University, Stony Brook University, Swedish Medical Center, UCLA, UCSF, University of Massachusetts, Ohio Health. \n\nThese sites represent a mix of academic and private practice settings; some are tertiary care centers for MS while others are general neurology clinics.	Study participants will be assigned to a class of therapies and will choose the therapy they prefer amongst from within the class, in consultation with their physician. First-line medications will include injectable (various formulations of interferon beta and glatiramer acetate as well as daclizumab) and oral (teriflunomide, dimethylfumarate, and fingolimod) medications. Higher-efficacy therapies are infused.	The contract period is five months in length. Our goal is to have the first person enrolled within 6 months of notification of award (which was on September 12, 2017). Completion of data analysis is anticipated during the peer review period (e.g. by the end of month 63).	Follow-up will be terminated approximately 52 months after the first patient enrolls (patients will be followed on a rolling basis up to two months prior to the contract period).	Dr. Mowry (Co-PI) has funding from Biogen and Genzyme for investigator-initiated studies. She is site PI of research studies sponsored by Biogen.  \n\nDr. Newsome (Co-PI) has research support from Biogen, Genentech, and Novartis. He has attended scientific advisory board meetings at Biogen, Genentech, and Celgene.	The statistician for the trial is Dr. Elizabeth Ogburn (Johns Hopkins School of Public Health).	Our proposal target was for sites to be enrolling by month 6. We had already been working with Dr. Daniel Ford to centralize the IRB process (SmartIRB). \n\nWe project that sites on average will enroll 22 participants over a 10-month period, or approximately 2 patients/month (while we at Johns Hopkins will aim to enroll 44 participants). We don't have major precedent, as pragmatic trials in MS are rare. Since nearly all newly-diagnosed patients are eligible for the study and the site PIs are on the Study Advisory Committee and adjudicated the final details of the protocol, we are optimistic we can reach our goals. \n\nNonetheless, completing subcontracts and obtaining central IRB approval are two of the biggest barriers to successfully launching and completing the trial. As such, this is a major focus of the requested consult/service.
1	2016-10-26	40	\N	\N	A comparative effectiveness trial of thyroid hormone replacement therapy	Thyroid study	3	Participants in this study will show differences in changes in thyroid-specific symptoms between baseline and 12 month follow-up after combination LT4-LT3 therapy or thyroid extract therapy, compared to LT4 alone.	Study design The study will be conducted as a parallel, double-blind, three comparator arms (all active treatments), twelve-month effectiveness, patient-centered outcome multicenter trial.	Participants in this study will show differences in changes in thyroid-specific symptoms between baseline and 12 month follow-up after combination LT4-LT3 therapy or thyroid extract therapy, compared to LT4 alone.	Primary outcome of the study will be changes in Thyroid Patient-Reported Outcome (ThyPro), a validated, disease specific quality of life instrument developed to assess thyroid-related symptomatology. This instrument correlates well with other validated quality of life instruments, but provides a more disease-specific dimension.	1	Inclusion Criteria:    ?       Use of LT4 at a dose of 1.2 mcg/kg/day or higher. The average dose in the absence of a thyroid is 1.6 mcg/kg/day [e.g., 112 mcg/day for a 70 kg (154 lb) individual]. We seek participants with little to no endogenous thyroid function.  ?       TSH of 0.5-4.0 within 2 months of enrollment. Lack of optimization of thyroid testing could contribute to residual symptoms. We seek participants who are symptomatic despite TSH levels that are within a standard reference range.  ?       Stable dose of LT4 for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Recent changes to LT4 dosing could affect symptoms. We seek participants who are persistently symptomatic despite stable LT4 dosing.  ?       Dissatisfied with LT4 therapy. See below under Specific Populations.       Exclusion Criteria:    ?       Current use of LT3 or thyroid extracts.  ?       Unstable cardiac condition. This includes uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, or angina.  ?       Current pregnancy or planned within the next 12 months. Frequent monitoring and dose titration are required during pregnancy. Any participants who become pregnant during the study will terminate the study.  ?       Diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus. TSH testing is not reliable in patients with these rare conditions.  ?       Active treatment for malignancy, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer. Patients with thyroid cancer who do not anticipate therapy with radioactive iodine over the next 12 months will be eligible for enrollment, as will women with treated breast cancer on stable doses of estrogen antagonist therapies, such as tamoxifen.  ?       Clinical indication for the suppression of TSH.  ?       Active severe uncontrolled psychiatric disorder	Not provided	We will randomize the study groups to LT4 alone, LT4 plus LT3, and thyroid extracts in a 1:1:1 fashion; LT4 and thyroid extracts will be administered on a once-daily regimen, while LT4 plus LT3 therapy will be administered on a twice-daily regimen. In the LT4 plus LT3 arm, the baseline LT4 dose will be reduced by 25 mcg of LT4 and 5 mcg LT3 twice daily will be added. The substitution of LT4 for thyroid extracts will be performed replacing 1 mg of thyroid extract for 1.47 mcg LT4, rounded to the nearest 10 mg. The study medications will be formulated in capsules by the University of Pennsylvania research pharmacy and the LT4 alone and thyroid extract arms will contain an LT3 placebo to mask the treatments. Two adjustments of the doses (at 1.5 and 6 months) aiming to achieve a TSH within normal range will be allowed throughout the study to mimic common practice. Study drugs will be dispensed at the time of the study visits.	This trial, conducted for a 1 year duration in a real life setting, will examine the effects of three available therapeutic options. The results will allow understanding of the benefits of alternative treatments for a common condition. This study will also allow evaluation of the impact of common genetic polymorphisms on the manifestation of hypothyroidism and on the response to therapies. This study, by addressing the unmet needs of a sizable number of patients, will provide patients and stakeholders with data to guide an informed and personalized choice of therapeutic options for treatment of hypothyroidism.

393	2018-09-07	40	\N	t	Smoking cessation in lung cancer screening: integrated digital/clinical approach	Smoking cessation in LDCT screening	6	This study is a practical clinical trial to examine the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions provided to patients who are receiving a Low Dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer.  A key aspect of the study is how best to implement smoking cessation intervention and engage smokers in the use of digital resources to aid cessation within a clinical lung screening program. \nWe will randomize N~1400 smokers (self-reported smoking within the past 30 days) who present for LDCT lung cancer screening to: 1) Usual Care (UC) control condition in which people will be provided brief motivational counseling and list of smoking cessation resources, 2) a digital (WEB+TXT) cessation intervention in which participants will be proactively enrolled, or 3) a digital cessation intervention combined with Tobacco Treatment Specialist counseling (WEB+TXT+TTS) in which participants will be proactively enrolled in the digital resources and will have face-to-face counseling. Guiding hypotheses are: \nHypothesis 1a: WEB+TXT+TTS will result in greater abstinence rates compared with WEB+TXT and UC. Hypothesis 1b: WEB+TXT will result in greater abstinence rates compared with UC.	This is a 3-arm, multi-site (6 sites), randomized controlled trial with a repeated measures design that compares: 1) Ask-Advise-Refer Usual Care approach (UC), 2) digital approach (WEB+TXT), and 3) digital approach + TTS counseling (WEB+TXT+TTS). 1400 participants will be randomly and equally assigned to each arm.  Participants will not be blinded to their study condition.	This study is a practical clinical trial to examine the effectiveness of two novel cessation interventions and a key aspect of their implementation jointly in one study. The effectiveness question is whether a combined digital/clinical intervention yields higher abstinence rates than a digital intervention alone. The implementation question is whether proactively linking smokers to digital treatment increases treatment uptake and engagement and improves outcomes compared to passive referral. These questions will be examined in a 3-arm randomized trial with repeated measures at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. We will randomize N=1400 smokers who present for LDCT lung cancer screening to one of three arms previously described: 1) Usual Care control condition (aligned with guidelines for "ask, advise, refer" approach), 2) a digital (WEB+TXT) cessation intervention in which participants will be proactively enrolled, or 3) a digital cessation intervention combined with Tobacco Treatment Specialist counseling (WEB+TXT+TTS). Primary aims are: \nAim 1 (Effectiveness): To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of WEB+TXT and WEB+TXT+TTS versus UC with regard to biochemically confirmed smoking abstinence at 12-months.\nAim 2 (Implementation): To examine whether proactive enrollment increases treatment use, and whether treatment use mediates the relationship between treatment assignment and smoking outcome. \nAim 3 (Reach & Adoption): To examine the representativeness of the study sample relative to all smokers screened for LDCT eligibility (reach) and potential for intervention implementation (adoption) among LDCT clinics.	Effectiveness will be evaluated with the primary outcome of self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence which is biochemically confirmed with expired air carbon monoxide (CO) at 12 months post-randomization. All participants who self-report 7-day point prevalence abstinence and have an expired air CO concentration ≤10ppm at the 12-month follow-up will be confirmed as abstinent from smoking. Participants who do not complete the 12-month follow-up or decline CO testing will be considered smokers. \n\nOther smoking-related outcomes include change in motivation to quit, quit attempts, 30-day and continuous abstinence measured at each follow-up.  Intervention satisfaction in all three arms will be measured with an adapted version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-3; α=.92). We will assess overall satisfaction and perceived helpfulness of the interventions, whether the intervention met their expectations (1=not at all, 5=very much), and whether they would recommend it to a friend (yes/no). In addition to overall satisfaction, we will measure satisfaction with specific intervention components. We will also assess participant engagement with the digital tools using metrics of time using the online resources and number of text messages received and responded to. We will assess the mediating impact of engagement on abstinence outcomes.	1	Participants are recruited from a pool of patients who meet the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) risk criteria for lung cancer screening (LDCT).  Patients can self-refer for LDCT screening or (more commonly) are referred by a clnician. Patients call a Mayo Clinic phone number and complete a brief intake interview during which demographic information, smoking history, current smoking status, and other data for risk calculation are collected. Eligibility criteria (per CMS) for LDCT screening are: 1) age 55-77, 2) asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of lung cancer), 3) 30+ pack year history of smoking, and 4) current smoker or one who has quit smoking within the last 15 years.\nEligibility criteria for entry into our study include: 1) current smoking (past 30 days every day or some days), 2) at least weekly use of the Internet, 3) cell phone ownership with a text messaging plan, and 4) willing to receive study text messages. Exclusion criteria are current use of cessation medication or participation in a tobacco cessation treatment program.	This multisite trial will include a mix of health care sites serving patients from varied and diverse communities across four states: three sites from the Mayo Clinic Health System, two Mayo Clinic campuses in urban areas, and a destination medical center in Rochester, MN, that serves patients from all 50 states. \nThree MCHS sites that will participate in this study: MCHS Mankato, MN is a 270-bed acute care hospital as well as 4 family medicine clinics in Mankato and 3 surrounding smaller communities. It serves communities in Blue Earth, Le Sueur, and Nicolette counties in Minnesota with a catchment area population of about 178,545; 14% of the population is over 65 and smoking prevalence is 18%. MCHS La Crosse, WI consists of two hospitals and 11 outpatient clinics serving 10 communities in Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota with a catchment area population of about 250,000 people; 14.5% of the population is over 65 and the smoking rate in La Crosse County is 20.2%. MCHS Eau Claire, WI is an 80-bed hospital and network of clinics serving 3 cities and 10 towns with a total catchment area population of 101,438; 12.8% of the population is over 65 and adult smoking rate in the county is 18%. \nMayo Clinic (MC) has major campuses in Rochester MN, Scottsdale and Phoenix AZ, and Jacksonville FL; all three sites will participate in the trial. Mayo Clinic Arizona serves 100,000 patients per year through a hospital and outpatient clinic in Phoenix and an outpatient clinic in Scottsdale; 17.3% are older than 55 and adult smoking prevalence is 15.3%. Mayo Clinic Florida serves about 100,000 patients per year through a hospital and outpatient clinic in Jacksonville; 17% are over the age of 55 and adult smoking rate is 16.8%. Mayo Clinic Rochester Minnesota serves about 1.1 million patients per year through 3 hospitals and a multi-disciplinary outpatient practice. It is primarily a destination medical center with about 70% of the patients arriving from greater than 50 miles.\nThese sites include a mix of facilities that are large and small, urban and rural. This variety in study sites will ensure generalizability to other health care systems and LCS programs in moderate to large health care facilities.	This is a minimal risk study and does not include any drug, device or biologic intervention. There is no radiation exposure as part of our trial since the LDCT is performed as part of the clinical lung screening program managed through the Departments of Radiology and Pulmonary Medicine at Mayo Clinic. Dr. David Midthun, the co-PI on the trial, is also the Medical Director for the Mayo Clinic Lung Cancer Screening Program.  The interventions include the previously described digital resources comprised of an internet resource provided through Truth Initiative (BecomeAnEX.org) and text messaging program with content and programming provided by Truth Initiative.  The in-person intervention includes only counseling with no additional testing or invasive procedures.  The lung screening CT scan is provided through the clinical programs and is not supported by our trial.	Study is open for enrollment as of August, 2017 (year 2 of the 5-year grant).  25 participants have been enrolled at one site (Rochester, MN). \nThe study timeline and budget are currently being restructured with NCI due to large carry-over funds resulting from slow enrollment during year 2 of the project. With the restructure we expect for the study to run through a year 6, providing years 3, 4, and 5 of the grant to complete enrollment and allow for 12-month follow-up to be completed (year 6) for all enrolled subjects. The plan is to enroll 1400 patients at six sites over 3 years from September 2018 to August 2021. Analysis is schedule to be completed by August 2022.	Participants are scheduled for telephone follow-ups at 1,3, and 6 months after enrollment The final visit at one year is to be scheduled in-person to coincide with a one year follow-up for yearly LDCT screen. Participants may receive up to $100 USD for completing all study visits.	There are no conflicts of interest for Mayo Clinic or for any study personnel.	To be conservative in our sample size calculations, efficacy estimates for UC are based on data  from patients in previous trials for lung cancer screening. We estimate that biochemically verified abstinence at 12 months for UC will be 10%. Efficacy estimates for WEB+TXT are based on several converging lines of evidence and we conservatively estimate that biochemically verified abstinence at 12 months for WEB+TXT will be 16%. Efficacy estimates for WEB+TXT+TTS are also based on several lines of evidence and we conservatively estimate that biochemically verified abstinence at 12 months for WEB+389 TXT+TTS will be 24%.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, analyses use an intent-to-treat (ITT) approach that analyzes\nsubjects by treatment assignment. We will use descriptive statistics to summarize demographic data, tobacco use history and other baseline characteristics. Summaries will be generated for the entire sample and by treatment arm. Given the randomized design, we will not assess for significant baseline treatment differences. With the exception of the stratification variable, no covariate adjustment will be included in the primary analysis. For all exploratory analyses, two tailed p-values will be reported with no adjustment for multiple comparisons. In all cases, findings will be reported using point estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Model assumptions for each analysis will be validated and transformations or nonparametric methods will be utilized as appropriate.\n\nWe will examine potential moderators (e.g., screening result, gender, age) by analyzing\ninteractions between treatment and selected variables. We will examine treatment/moderator interaction term on outcomes after entering main effects. We will also explore moderators of the relationship between treatment assignment 441 and treatment utilization.	Study enrolls patients who have completed at least a brief telephone screen to determine eligibility for lung cancer screening.  In our current scheme, we can contact patients who have completed the phone screen and have a future appointment for lung cancer screening.  Although we have not activated it, we have approval to obtain informed consent remotely using the telephone and an electronic document signing program.  Before completing the screening CT scan every patient must complete a shared decision making process.  This is an in-person visit with a clinician who discussed his risks and benefits of lung screening and makes a final determination of the patient's eligibility.  Once this visit is completed the lung screening CT scan can be completed either the same day or at a future visit.\nWe are able to identify each patient who has a future appointment for shared decision making and CT scan.  We contact these patients by letter or by telephone to assess interest in the study.  Interested subjects can now complete informed consent on the telephone or may have an appointment scheduled to visit with the study coordinator for informed consent visit and completion of baseline data.  We are also able to contact patients within 2 weeks of completion of the CT scan to assess interest in the study.  Finally, we are able to provide study personnel to be present at the time shared decision making is completed to provide potential participants with information about the study prior to completing the CT scan.\nOur first site opened enrollment in August 2017 (Rochester, MN). Additional sites have been delayed because of the enrollment problems we experienced in site #1. We need Rochester to enroll 12-15 subjects per month, and the other 5 sites will need to enroll 6-8 subjects per month for 30-36 months to meet targets. We had preliminary data suggesting we could enroll over half of all eligible subjects coming into the lung screening program. Recruitment is critically important since patients are coming primarily for lung screening, and not for smoking cessation.

We are currently enrolling 7-11 subjects per month, with 58% sites activated.  \n\nTwo upcoming measures that may help stimulate additional enrollment are the activation of the SETPOINT2 smartphone app to assist with screening and enrollment, and a plan to pay sites for screening.  We hope to have these measures in place by mid February.\n\nWe have been conducting web meetings every 2-3 months to stimulate interest and answer the questions of our site PIs and coordinators.  We have also been calling and emailing at regular intervals to sites that are not active in screening or enrollments.

One trial will assess treatment differences between intensive medical management alone compared to CEA plus intensive medical management. The parallel trial will assess treatment differences between intensive medical management alone compared to CAS plus intensive medical management. Intensive medical management will involve control of blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, cigarette smoking, and other vascular risk factors	CREST-2 is a set of two parallel trials assessing: 1) the treatment differences between intensive medical management compared with CEA, and 2) the treatment differences between intensive medical management compared to CAS. Each is a two-arm, randomized trial of approximately 1,240 asymptomatic patients with high-grade stenosis randomized to receive revascularization plus intensive medical management (CAS or CEA) versus intensive medical management alone (MEDICAL). A decision as to which trial the participant will be enrolled (MEDICAL-vs.-CEA or MEDICAL-vs.-CAS) will be made prior to randomization and will be informed by CREST results. Intensive medical management will be provided equally to both the CAS/CEA and MEDICAL groups, and will employ techniques successfully employed in the recently completed SAMMPRIS trial. We anticipate recruitment will be completed over a 5-year period, with the last patient being followed for 2 years (7-years of patient-related activity). An assessment of the expected and observed number of events will be made at a point where 60% to 90% of the participants have been recruited (exact timing to be determined in agreement with the DSMB and NINDS Staff), and a possible adaption of the sample size will be made to ensure adequate statistical power	There are two equally important primary hypotheses, which will be tested on and intention-to-treat basis in two independent parallel, randomized clinical trials. One trial will test the primary hypothesis that intensive medical management differs from the combination of CEA and intensive medical management in preventing the primary endpoint in patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis. One trial will test the primary hypothesis that intensive medical management differs from the combination of CAS and intensive medical management in preventing the primary endpoint in patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis.	The proportion of patients who experienced any stroke (WHO: World Health Organization definition) or death within 44 days of randomization or ipsilateral ischemic stroke thereafter up to 4 years (estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival function). An end-of-study brain MR scan will be used to determine the tissue based stroke endpoints in both studies (CEA and CAS). Potential treatment-related differences in stroke risk as assessed by a combination of the primary clinically-defined stroke and potential silent infarctions detected in the end-of-study brain-MRI will be analyzed. In addition, potential treatment-related differences in other adverse MRI characteristics such as white matter disease or atrophy will be assessed.	1	1. Patients ≥35 years old.\n2. Carotid stenosis defined as:\n• Stenosis ≥70% by catheter angiography (NASCET Criteria);\nOR\n• by DUS with ≥70% stenosis defined by a peak systolic velocity of at least 230 cm/s plus at least one of the following:\na) an end diastolic velocity ≥100 cm/s, or\nb) internal carotid/common carotid artery peak systolic velocity ratio ≥4.0, or\nc) CTA with ≥ 70% stenosis, or\nd) MRA with ≥ 70% stenosis.	The Credentialing and Site Selection Committee will use the previously reported methods that were documented as successful in CREST for forming the investigative team. The site-specific results of CREST and site data quality will enable the Committee to select objectively the best centers for participation. Subjects will be enrolled, randomized, and treated at about 150 clinical centers in the U.S., Canada, and other international sites. Centers will be encouraged to recruit patients across the full spectrum of high-grade carotid artery stenosis (70% through 99%).	\N	60 months	4 years	\N	\N	Enrollment strategies and mechanisms for recruitment in CREST-2 will be patterned after the demonstrated effectiveness of those used in CREST. CREST-2 recruitment plans and tactics will be site-specific depending on the characteristics of the site (academic or community-based), the medical specialty and referral population of the site PI (neurology, cardiology, radiology, surgery, neurosurgery), the size and location of the site (e.g. Canada), or upon the target population (e.g. women and minorities). A multiplicity of tactics has proven to be more important than a single best tactic or tool, as described in the Manual of Operations (MOP). Potential study participants will be identified from hospitalized patients; patients referred to a vascular laboratory for noninvasive assessment of the carotid arterial system and angiography suites; and neurology, vascular or cardiology clinics and offices. Most asymptomatic carotid stenoses are discovered by carotid ultrasonography in patients with vascular disease in other vascular territories. Recruitment strategies will be used within vascular laboratories; angiography suites; and neurology, vascular or cardiology clinics and offices. Screeners of patients will be trained and retrained on the eligibility criteria of the trial. General community educational strategies to increase awareness of the trial will also be conducted in communities that are served by CREST-2 sites. As feasible, potential participants meeting eligibility criteria and offered enrollment will be recorded into a screening log. The screening log process will be tailored on a site by site basis.

397	2018-09-11	5	\N	t	The Peer-based Retention Of people who Use Drugs in Rural Research	PROUD-R2	2	Optimal strategies for recruiting and retaining people with opioid use disorder in clinical research in rural America remain unknown. The Peer-based Retention Of people who Use Drugs in Rural Research (PROUD-R2) study leverages the national Rural Opioids Initiative infrastructure, with sites in rural Oregon and Appalachian Kentucky and Ohio, and partnerships with three Clinical and Translational Science Award sites and the NIDA Clinical Trials Network to test an innovative peer-based strategy to improve research participation and retention of people who use drugs in rural communities.	This is a prospective, two-arm, cluster-randomized trial, with intervention allocation by respondent-driven sampling (RDS) chain. RDS involves identification of initial participants, termed "seeds" who in turn recruit others, and who in turn recruit others, until the desired sample size is reached. Upon enrollment in the PROUD-R2 study, all participants will be assigned the allocation as designated to their cluster (parent RDS chain). The randomization will be stratified by site and will be weighted for RDS chain length. Each cluster will be allocated to receive instruction on standard retention strategies or a more in depth recruitment and retention training as well as continued support and incentives for retaining peers.	Aim 1: Conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-driven study retention intervention for retaining PWUD in the Kentucky, Ohio, and Oregon Rural Opioid Initiative sites.\nH1a:  Participants in RDS chains receiving the peer retention intervention will have 20% higher retention at 12 months (primary outcome) than those receiving the standard retention approach, alone. \nH1b:  Participants in RDS chains receiving the peer retention intervention will have higher retention at 6 months (secondary outcome) compared with those receiving the standard retention approach, alone. \n\nAim 2: Elicit preferences of PWUD to participate in future clinical trials. \nAim 2a. Administer baseline survey of discrete choice experiment preferences for participating in clinical trials of potential medical innovations (e.g. new treatments for OUD, HIV and HCV vaccination). \nH2a: Participants will identify travel time as the most important attribute, followed by visit frequency. \nAim 2b. Compare participant survey preferences regarding willingness to participate in clinical trials at baseline, 6, and 12 months.\nH2b. Participants in RDS chains receiving the peer retention intervention will have higher willingness to participate in future clinical trials compared with those receiving the standard retention approach, alone.\n\nAim 3: Explore participant perceptions of clinical research participation and retention among PWUD in rural America.  Semi-structured interviews explore perceptions among 1) participants who enrolled but were not retained at 12 months, and 2) those that completed 12 months of study participation.	Primary: 12-Month Retention. Defined as completion of the 12 month study visit within 1 month of the original scheduled appointment. \n\nSecondary: 6 month Retention. Defined as completion of the 6-month study visit within one month of the original scheduled appointment. \n\nSecondary: Willingness to Participate in Clinical Trial. Defined as responses assessed as "likely" to the question "If there was a clinical trial on [X] in this community, how likely would people who use drugs in this community be to volunteer to be in it?" \n\nSecondary: Preferences for Clinical Trial Participation. Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE) to determine the preferences for participating in clinical trials for potential medical innovations.	1	Participants will be recruited from people who are enrolled in the National Rural Opioids Initative (NROI) sites in rural Oregon and Appalachian Kentucky and Ohio. The eligibility for NROI are those who 1) live in the study area, 2) have recently injected drugs or report opioid use to get high without injection and 3) are age 18 or grater. \n\nFor this study anyone participating in the NROI sites involved in this proposal who have successfully referred at least one other participant in PROUD-R2 within 3 months of NROI enrollment or are part of a respondent driven sampling (RDS) chain are eligible. \n\nThere are no exclusion criteria.	Oregon Health and Science University \nUniversity of Kentucky\nOhio State University	Each cluster, or Response Driven Sampling chain, will be randomized to either the control arm or the intervention arm. Those in the control arm will receive the standard retention strategy those in the intervention arm will receive the standard retention strategy in addition to a video-based and in-person training with the sites' Retention Specialist focused on how to encourage study retention among their peer recruit(s).	55-60 months	12 months	\N	For our primary outcome (study retention at 12-months-Aim 1), we will test whether retention is higher at 12 months in the peer-driven retention arm compared with standard retention. To do so, we will conduct regression modeling with the retention arm (peer-driven vs. standard) as the dependent variable and retention at 12 months as the independent variable (retained vs. not retained). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be used to account for the correlation introduced by the clustering of chains within sites. Since the outcome is dichotomous, we will use GEE with a logit link and 95% confidence intervals obtained from bootstrapped standard errors to correct for potential underestimation.2 When modeling the correlation structure, we explore different covariance matrices and choose the one that best fits the data. We will use RDS weights in our regression analysis. As recommended in the RDS methodology literature, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis comparing weighted to unweighted results of GEE.3-7\n\nTo calculate the weights, we will use the Volz-Heckathorn (VH) estimator. This estimator consistently outperforms the Salganik-Heckathorn estimator and produces more stable results for short recruitment chains.8,9 Because of the ongoing UG3 studies, we will start recruitment for this study in the middle of some chains (see Figure 2) thus anticipate some shorter chains may be included in this study. Further, the VH estimator does not rely on population size - which is not known or easily estimable in our population - unlike other estimators like the successive sampling estimator. \n\nFor the analysis of the willingness to participate in future clinical trials we use descriptive statistics to report responses and assess associations between participant characteristics, including randomization assignment, using the methods described for retention outcomes.  We will evaluate group differences in willingness to participate in future trials between the standard and peer-intervention arm at 6 and 12 months using GEE regression methods similar to those outlined for Aim 1. \n\nFor the analysis of participant preferences for participation in clinical trials, we will use STATA 15 to analyze preference data (patterns of choices and determine directionality and relative importance of each attribute level) using mixed multinomial logit (MNL) and generalized MNL (GMNL) models.\n\nQualitative analysis of Aim 2 and Aim 3 will also be used.	All National Rural Opioids Initiative (NROI) participants enrolled after April 2019 in Oregon, Ohio and Kentucky will be offered to participate in the concomitant PROUD-R2 study through a concomitant, but separate consent form. NROI RDS "seeds" who consent to participate in PROUD-R2 will be randomized to the PROUD-R2 intervention arm or control after they have recruited at least one peer by 3-months post-enrollment in NROI.

302	2018-03-13	5	\N	\N	GM-CSF for Reversal of immunopAralysis in pediatriC sEpsis-induced MODS	GRACE	1	For the GRACE study we hypothesize that the proportion of children who persistently resolve immunoparalysis (demonstration of a TNF alpha response greater than or equal to 200 pg/ml following both the 3rd and 7th scheduled doses of GM-CSF) will be greater than or equal to 8 out of 10 subjects via both IV and SQ dosing routes.	We will carry out a prospective project design as an open-label, multi-center, interventional trial in which children\nwith sepsis-induced MODS undergo surveillance immune function testing beginning on Day 2 of MODS. We will enroll sequentially in treatment arms to ensure some balance within the cohorts with respect to corticosteroid use and age. Those who demonstrate immunoparalysis (TNF alpha response < 200 pg/ml) will receive a 7-day course of GM-CSF. Study drug will be administered in 4 sequential treatment arms. Enrollment will begin in the 125 dose IV arm. If 125 IV does not prove successful, we will move to the 250 IV dose arm. If an IV arm is successful, we will open a SQ arm of the same dose. If we begin with 125 SQ arm, then we will move to the 250 SQ arm if the 125 SQ arm is not successful. A successful dose and route is measured by the resolution of immunoparalysis in 8 out of the \ffirst 10 subjects in a treatment arm.\n\nIn cases were the treatment arm is not successful, as soon as a 3rd subject in an arm has failed, that arm is considered to have failed. If the treatment arm is at the 125 dose, we will escalate immediately without fully enrolling the 125 dose arm. If the study treatment arm is at the 250 dose, we will continue enrolling to fully complete the arm for the purpose of understanding the PK in the failed route. Enrollment will not stop early in a study treatment arm due to achieving 8 successes. Instead we will continue to enroll until that study treatment arm is complete and we have con\ffirmed that the arm has a sufficient number of evaluable subjects who have received study drug.	1.) Establish the immunologic efficacy of GM-CSF administered by the IV and SQ routes in children with immunoparalysis in the setting of sepsis-induced MODS.\n2.) Estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters by the IV and SQ GM-CSF administered in pediatric sepsis-induced MODS.\n3.) Demonstrate the feasibility of screening, enrollment, drug delivery, and sample collection for a multi-center immunostimulation trial in children with sepsis-induced MODS.	Comparisons for this study will be primarily descriptive. The cohort will be characterized with simple statistical summaries, i.e. frequencies, means, standard deviations, medians, and interquartile ranges. An arm will be considered successful if 8 of the \ffirst 10 completing subjects in the arm have a good immune response, i.e. TNF alpha > 200 pg/mL on Day 4 and Day 8 after initiation of GM-CSF. We hope to illustrate the distribution over the treatment course of TNF alpha, IL-6, and IL-8. Pharmacokinetic modeling of GM-CSF will be conducted using non-linear mixed models as implemented in NONMEM (version VI, ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD). All other inferential analyses that may be conducted will be considered exploratory and will be reported as such.	2	Inclusion criteria are admission to the PICU or CTICU at a participating site, age of 40 gestational weeks to less than 18 years of age, greater than or equal to 2 new organ dysfunctions measure by the proulx criteria compared to pre-sepsis baseline, and suspected infection as an MODS inciting event.

Imaging in Dementia	5	The over-arching goals of the NEW IDEAS Study is to develop precision approaches to inform amyloid PET coverage decisions that incorporate new knowledge that has emerged since the original IDEAS study was designed.	NEW IDEAS is an observational, open-label, longitudinal cohort study which seeks to evaluate the impact of an amyloid PET scan on patient management in specific sub-populations. Patients with MCI or dementia and meeting study eligibility criteria will be identified by dementia specialists (physicians board-certified in geriatric medicine, psychiatry, or neurology who spend >25% of patient contact time assessing patients with cognitive disorders) for potential study participation.  The dementia specialist's intended management plan for the participant (pre-PET assessment) will be collected and compared to the actual management plan 90 days after the PET scan (post-PET assessment).

481	2019-03-18	20	\N	t	Simulation-Based Mastery Learning Ventricular Assist Device Self-Care Curriculum to Improve Patient Outcomes and Quality of Life: The SimVAD Trial	The SimVAD Trial	6	This study will determine the efficacy of a simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) ventricular assist device (VAD) curriculum, developed at Northwestern University, on VAD-related complications and patient quality of life and caregiver burden.\n\nHypothesis: Patients who complete the SBML VAD curriculum, with their caregivers, will have lower rates of clinical complications and will report higher quality of life and lower burden after training compared to prior patients and caregivers who received usual VAD training.	No rigorous standardized training exists for patients and caregivers to ensure mastery of VAD self-management. Therefore, we developed an SBML VAD curriculum for patients and caregivers in order to make VAD training universal, improve trainee skills and health-care quality of life (HRQOL) and reduce clinical complications.  In a randomized-controlled trial at our single site, we demonstrated SBML provided superior learning outcomes compared to usual training. We were under-powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes and HRQOL.  Therefore, we plan to extend the intervention to 12 other sites via a randomized step-wedge design where sites are initially assigned to no intervention and then "roll over" or "cross over" to the intervention group at different time points. By the end of the trial, all sites receive the intervention.  Every 6 months, "SimVAD champions" from Northwestern will travel to 2 participating sites where they will train VAD self-care training staff how to use the curriculum. Those sites will then begin training their patients and caregivers using the SBML VAD curriculum until all sites have received the intervention.  We will compare outcomes before and after intervention among all sites.\n\nWe will also evaluate patient and caregiver healthcare quality of life, self-efficacy, and caregiver burden by giving patients and their caregivers low burden surveys (shown to produce valid data) at three, six, and 12 months after their VAD implantation. We will compare survey responses between the controls and intervention groups. \n\nFinally, we will interview up to 50 advanced heart failure physicians and VAD coordinators (who take care of VAD patients) using semi-structured interviews and constant comparative technique at the implementation of the curriculum and 12 months later. We will identify themes until saturation is achieved.	AIM 1. Determine the efficacy of the SBML curriculum on clinical complications including driveline infections (primary endpoint), strokes, and all-cause, unplanned re-hospitalizations through one year after VAD implantation.\nAIM 2.  Evaluate the effect of the SBML curriculum on patient and caregiver health-related quality of life (HRQOL), self-efficacy, and caregiver burden through one year after VAD implantation.\nAIM 3. Evaluate patient, caregiver and healthcare provider perceptions about the extent to which the SBML curriculum addresses existing facilitators and barriers to VAD self-management.	Primary endpoint: VAD driveline infections\nSecondary endpoint: HRQOL, self-efficacy, caregiver burden &  perceptions about SBML curriculum	1	Patient inclusion criteria include being a current advanced heart failure patient with VAD implantation scheduled, age >18, English or Spanish speaking, receiving implantation and VAD care at one of the study sites, and meet hospital criteria for VAD implantation. \nProvider inclusion criteria will be serving in the proper role at their hospital and ability to speak English, age >18. \n\nVulnerable populations of patients will not be included in this study (including fetuses, neonates, children, pregnant women, prisoners, mentally retarded or incompetent individuals, institutionalized individuals, or individuals unable to give consent due to their medical condition). Fetuses and neonates are not the focus of our study. Pregnant women will not be included since pregnancy is a contraindication to VAD implantation It is possible that VAD caregivers may be pregnant at the time of the study. Patients with mental retardation, mental incompetence, or patients who are unable to give consent due to their medical condition will not be included as they will not be able to complete measures (and are not often implanted with VAD). Lastly, institutionalized individuals will not be included as access will be a problem, and these individuals are rarely referred for VAD implantation.

The SBML VAD curriculum is made up of several components. First, patients and caregivers undergo a baseline (pretest) assessment on 3 VAD self-care skills using a simulator and skills checklists. This assessment includes controller, power source, and driveline dressing changes (caregiver only). Subsequently, patients and caregivers watch videos created by the investigators (also provided to participants at discharge) on controller and dressing changes with pictures of abnormal driveline skin site pictures. Written materials are reviewed including alarms (using visual reminder cards also provided at discharge), medications, and VAD parameter information.  Subsequently, the patient and caregiver participate in deliberate practice with individualized feedback of controller, power source and dressing changes on a simulator (minimum of 3 times for each procedure). Finally, participants undergo a posttest of simulated skills on controller, power source and dressing changes (caregiver only) on the simulator using the same skills checklist as well as a written examination which covers alarms, medications and VAD parameters. All participants are required to meet or exceed a previously established minimum passing standard (MPS) for each of the skills and written exams. Those who are unable to meet or exceed the MPS undergo further deliberate skills practice on the simulator until they are retested and achieve this standard. At three, six and 12 month intervals patients and caregivers will undergo reassessment of the 3 VAD self-care skills on the simulator.  Those who are unable to meet or exceed the MPS at follow-up intervals will undergo further deliberate practice until they can be retested and meet the standard.	60 months	12 months	Northwestern University owns the intellectual property of the VAD curriculum and the created videos and checklists are copyrighted	\N	Once a study site is "crossed over" and begins the intervention, all patients/caregivers will be expected to participate in the intervention as part of a quality improvement project.

48	2016-12-07	99	\N	\N	Comparative Effectiveness Study of Treatments to Prevent Coronary Artery Damage in Patients with Resistant Kawasaki Disease	Kawasaki Study	\N	Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether infliximab or IVIG is a better therapy for IVIG-resistant Kawasaki disease (KD) patients.     Hypothesis: We postulate that infliximab will be superior to a second intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion for treatment of persistent or recrudescent fever in children with KD who fail to become afebrile after the first IVIG infusion (resistant KD).	Overall Study Design    We propose a randomized, clinical trial of the two leading secondary therapies for IVIG-resistant KD patients with permuted block randomization by center at 25 collaborating clinical sites. The primary outcome measure will be fever at 24 h following initiation of study drug infusion. Secondary outcomes will be the change in levels of inflammatory parameters and change in coronary artery Z score by echocardiogram. PROs will be analyzed and incorporated into the final assessment.    Main components of the intervention:    IVIG-resistant KD patients (defined as T? 38.0�C rectally or orally between 36 hours and 7 days after end of IVIG infusion without another likely cause) will be randomized to receive either infliximab (10 mg/kg) or second IVIG infusion (2g/kg). The primary outcome measure will be fever 24 hours after the initiation of their study drug infusion. Subjects with persistent fever at 24 hours will cross-over to the other study treatment. Patients who are afebrile 24 hours following initiation of study drug administration will be discharged on low dose aspirin. Patients will return for an echocardiogram and laboratory assessment at 2 weeks following discharge.     Study Design and Randomization:  This is a 3-year (2.75-year of enrollment), Phase III, two-arm, randomized, multi-center, superiority treatment study to compare infliximab to a second intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion for treatment of persistent or recrudescent fever in children with KD who fail to become afebrile after the first IVIG infusion. The trial will be open label but the outcome adjudication will be blinded. Once eligibility and consent are confirmed, subjects will be assigned to a treatment arm by the pharmacy according to a pre-specified randomization scheme stratified by center and then sex (male/female) and age (dichotomous variable >1 year or ? 1 year) via a randomly permuted block design of block sizes of 2 and 4. The randomization sequence will be generated by the Biostatistics team using the software R (version 3.1.1).  The electronic randomization list will be securely transmitted to the pharmacy team at each site, who will randomize subjects based on this list. It would not be possible to blind the treatment as the infusion times and nursing protocols are very different for the two treatments. Infliximab is given over two hours and IVIG is given over 8-12 hours with specific nursing monitoring for infusion reactions and incremental increases in the infusion rate. To ensure appropriate representation of subjects from all study sites, we may consider restricting enrollment from any site that exceeds 30% of the total study enrollment.  This approach will be discussed and evaluated on the investigator calls with all sites.        Outcome Measures and Schedule of Measurements:    1) Fever: Cessation of fever (<38�C rectally or orally) within 24h of initiation of study drug infusion will be the primary outcome measure. This will be assessed by measurements of temperature taken from enrollment to 24 hours of study drug infusion.     2) Resolution of Inflammation: This will be measured by the change in white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration between baseline, 24 hours and 2 weeks following study treatment.    3) Coronary artery changes: This will compare the echocardiographic Z scores of the left anterior descending coronary artery and right coronary artery at baseline and 2 weeks following study treatment .	Specific Aims:    1) Specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that infliximab will be superior to a second intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion for treatment of persistent or recrudescent fever in children with KD who fail to become afebrile after the first IVIG infusion (resistant KD). Cessation of fever (<38�C rectally or orally) within 24h of initiation of study drug infusion will be the primary outcome measure.    2) Specific aim 2 will test the hypothesis that infliximab treatment will result in more rapid resolution of inflammation compared to second IVIG as measured by the change in white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration between baseline, 24 hours and 2 weeks following study treatment.    3) Specific aim 3 will test the hypothesis that infliximab treatment will result in a change from baseline in coronary artery Zworst score of ? 0.05 standard deviation units as compared to second IVIG at 2 weeks following study treatment measured by echocardiography.	Cessation of fever (<38�C rectally or orally) within 24h of initiation of study drug infusion will be the primary outcome measure.	2	Eligible subjects will be as follows:    1)     1. 4 weeks to 17 years of age,    2)     2. fulfill the American Heart Association case definition for KD,    3)     3. have had fever (T ?38�C) for 3 to 10 days prior to initial IVIG treatment, and    4)    4.  persistently febrile between 36 hours and 7 days after end of IVIG infusion without other likely cause	\N	IVIG-resistant KD patients (defined as T? 38.0�C rectally or orally between 36 hours and 7 days after end of IVIG infusion without another likely cause) will be randomized to receive either infliximab (10 mg/kg) or second IVIG infusion (2g/kg).	\N	\N	There are no financial interests or potential conflicts to disclose.	Since this is a superiority study design, an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be used to analyze the outcome data regarding patient outcomes. Results will be reported as point estimates (odds ratios or mean differences across groups, as appropriate) and interval estimates (95% confidence intervals).  All tests of significance for the secondary outcomes will be 2-sided and Hochberg adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons.  A p-value ? 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  Statistical analysis will be conducted using the statistical software R 3.1.1. (www.rproject.org).  Demographic and baseline characteristics will be compared between the study arms using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and a two-sample t-test for continuous variables.  Appropriate non-parametric alternatives will be considered, if parametric assumptions fail.     Analysis of Primary Outcome (Specific Aim 1): The primary outcome (Specific Aim 1) of the study is cessation of fever (<38�C rectally or orally) within 24h of initiation of study drug infusion, which is a dichotomous (binary) variable.  Comparison between the infliximab and second IVIG arms will be compared using a Fisher's exact test for proportions. Differences in the rates between the two groups, along with the odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  As a secondary/sensitivity analysis, multivariable logistic regression analysis will be performed to study the association between clinical and demographic factors (age < 1 yr., sex, ESR, WBC, ANC, hsCRP) and intervention arm, adjusting for baseline demographic, stratification variables, and clinical characteristics. Variables significantly associated with both treatment group and outcome (p<0.10) will be included in a multivariable logistic regression model as covariates.      Analysis of Secondary Outcomes (Specific Aim 2):  The first secondary outcome (Specific Aim 2) will test the hypothesis that infliximab treatment will result in more rapid resolution of inflammation compared to second IVIG as measured by WBC, ANC, and levels of hsCRP at 24 hours and 2 weeks following study treatment. Comparisons between the Infliximab and second IVIG arms will be compared using a two-sample, two-sided t-test at each time point separately. Point estimates and their 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  As a secondary/sensitivity analysis, multiple linear regression at each time point will be performed to study the association between clinical and demographic factors (age < 1 yr., sex, ESR, WBC, ANC) and intervention arm, adjusting for baseline demographic, stratification variables, and clinical characteristics, including baseline hsCRP. Variables significantly associated with both treatment group and outcome (p<0.10) will be included in a multiple regression model as covariates.      Analysis of Secondary Outcomes (Specific Aim 3): This secondary outcome (Specific Aim 3) will test the hypothesis that infliximab treatment will result in a change in coronary artery Zworst score of ? 0.05 standard deviation units as compared to second IVIG at 2 weeks following study treatment measured by echocardiography. Methods analogous to the analysis of Specific Aim 2 will be applied, including t-tests and regression models. Inter-rater reliability analysis will be conducted using Cohen's Kappa statistics and multi-level modeling to measure agreement.  In addition, to minimize disagreement, the Coordinating Center has developed manuals used in previous clinical trials to help standardize performance of echocardiograms and the measurement of the coronary arteries. During the run in period, a de-identified echocardiogram on a KD patient will be submitted to the coordinating center at UCSD and the quality will be assessed and feedback given to the center PI.	\N
138	2017-04-25	3	\N	\N	Anti-inflammatory therapy to augment CFTR rescue in CF patients	Cystic Fibrosis Study	\N	The life span of patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) continues to be shortened by progressive lung disease. A key initiating event is a failure to maintain adequate mucociliary clearance (MCC). In vivo studies show that baseline MCC is initially maintained at near normal levels in patients. In vitro, airway surface liquid (ASL) volume in human CF airway epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) is often sufficient to maintain MCC. The eventual development of mucociliary dysfunction, via ASL volume depletion and mucus adhesion, results from airway inflammation, in part due to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. TGF-beta1 is a CF disease modifier linked to worse pulmonary outcome. Furthermore, therapy with the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor does not rapidly eliminate airway inflammation despite improvement in CFTR conductance of the G551D mutant.                       ASL regulation in the airway depends on Na absorption via the ENaC, Cl secretion via CFTR and CaCC, as well as K secretion via BK channels. BK channels are usually voltage-dependent, and therefore require the gamma regulatory subunit LRRC26 for activity in non-excitatory cells. Secretion of K by apical BK channels provides a driving force for Cl secretion, forming a so-called apical loop current that is important for ASL fluid availability. BK inhibition and knock down reduces ASL volume, even in the presence of fully functional CFTR. Data from our and other laboratories show that in the presence of mutant CFTR, TGF-beta1 decreases CaCCs and BK activities, the latter by a reduction in LRRC26. The result is a loss of ASL. Thus, in this model using primary cells from CF patients, TGF-beta1-mediated inflammation impairs the backup mechanism for Cl (and K) secretion. Furthermore, inflammation has been shown to compromise mutant CFTR recovery by CFTR correctors.                        Given these data, novel approaches to treat airway inflammation could improve CF outcomes, especially in patients not eligible for small molecule therapy. Losartan, used clinically as an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), has strong anti-inflammatory effects and inhibits TGF-beta signaling. Preliminary data show that losartan rescues BK function and ASL volume in vitro in TGF-beta1-treated CF cells, and reverses mucociliary dysfunction in vivo in sheep challenged with TGF-beta1 or with CFTRinh172 plus human neutrophil elastase (HNE; TGF-beta1 is downstream of HNE). In a CF patient, losartan also reduced systemic inflammation while improving ATP-mediated changes in nasal potential difference measurements (reflecting improved CaCC and BK function). We therefore hypothesize that reduction of CF-associated airway inflammation by losartan will recover the functions of CaCCs and BK, thereby improving ASL and enhancing mucociliary function. The experiments could identify a 'low-hanging-fruit' intervention for CF.	Study plan: Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in another tab. Attached table illustrates the timeline.                                             Briefly, 16 patients with CF, >18 years of age, who are not on CFTR augmentation therapy will be recruited for this trial (4 per year). After signing informed consent at the screening visit, we will perform spirometry, take blood (see below), and test for pregnancy where applicable. Since losartan has teratogenic effects, we will enforce strict birth control in female participants. Eligible patients will complete visits as outlined in graph and table below.                                             Measurements: Quality of life will be assessed by CFQ-R (CF quality of life questionnaire - revised). Cytokines will be measured from nasal fluid collected by Leukosorb filter paper. After assessing baselines, a daily dose of 50 mg losartan will be started, followed by a safety visit 7 days after treatment start (� 2 days). Then, the losartan dose will be increased to 100 mg daily until week 14. Since this trial assesses anti-inflammatory effects of losartan, the total duration will be 14 weeks to achieve >12 weeks of treatment with losartan.	Clinical in vivo aim 3 of the application will test the prediction that oral losartan will improve MCC as well as lung function and decrease airway and systemic inflammation in CF patients who are not on small molecule treatment. An IND exemption for losartan use in CF patients was approved by the FDA. The proposal will test the ability and mechanisms of an available anti-inflammatory medication to improve MCC in CF iin vivo.      Endpoints    � Primary endpoint: Change from baseline (off losartan) in mucociliary and cough clearance (MCC+CC) on losartan    � Secondary endpoints       FEV1 (absolute and relative changes)       Changes in serum inflammatory markers (hsCRP, WBC including absolute neutrophil count, %PMNs, serum amyloid A or SAA, calprotectin, GM-CSF, TGF-b active and total)       Quality of life questionnaire (CFQ-R)       Blood levels: losartan, EXP3179, and EXP3174 by high-performance liquid chromatography (41,43)       Nasal cytokine changes (TGF-b1 active and total, TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, COX-2)       LRRC26 mRNA (correlates with BK activity in vitro, see preliminary data) and TGF-beta mRNA  expression in nasal cells by qPCR (while some contamination with other cells is possible, 'purification' with for instance cell           sorting is not feasible given the small number of cells; we will assess purity after cytospin with epithelial cell markers using immunofluorescence).	Primary hypothesis: Losartan (100 mg for >12 weeks) will improve MCC+cough clearance (CC) in CF patients NOT on CFTR augmentation therapy.    Secondary hypotheses: Losartan will  reduce nasal cytokine levels as well as systemic inflammatory markers and may improve lung function and quality of life.             Endpoints      Primary endpoint: Change in mucociliary and cough clearance (MCC+CC) on losartan            Secondary endpoints:  FEV1 (absolute and relative changes)  Changes in serum inflammatory markers (hsCRP, WBC including absolute neutrophil count, %PMNs, serum amyloid A or SAA, calprotectin, GM-CSF, TGF-b active and total)  Quality of life questionnaire (CFQ-R)  Blood levels: losartan, EXP3179, and EXP3174 by high-performance liquid chromatography  Nasal cytokine changes (TGF-b1 active and total, TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, COX-2)  LRRC26 mRNA (correlates with BK activity in vitro, see preliminary data) and TGF-beta1 mRNA expression in nasal cells by qPCR (while some contamination with other cells is possible, 'purification' with for instance cell sorting is not feasible given the small number of cells; we will assess purity after cytospin with epithelial cell markers using immunofluorescence).                  Measures of Compliance: Analysis of blood levels of losartan and the metabolites EXP3179/EXP3174 as well as pill count (patients will bring medication supply to visits). Medication will be supplied and dispensed through our research pharmacy.	1	Inclusion criteria  Total of 16 CF patients with any known mutation combination not on CFTR augmentation therapy (females and males)  ?18 years of age  Severity of the Disease: Suitable patients will have mild to moderate lung disease, as defined by:      FEV1 ?40% of predicted at the screening visit.

Patients using intermittent inhaled or oral antibiotics will be allowed to participate in this trial. Patients on chronic, cycling antibiotics will be required to have completed at least 2 full cycles of the prescribed antibiotic prior to enrollment and should be studied during the same phase of treatment (on or off) during each study period.

Not provided	Not provided	\N	Statistics:   For the formal analysis, mixed effects models will be used. We will determine the final analytic approach based on the final available data. Only cases with complete data will be included. For secondary endpoints, we will investigate the distributional properties of the defined outcome measures - such as FEV1, changes in inflammatory markers, etc. Necessary transformations will be applied to satisfy normality assumptions if necessary. Baseline values of all variables will be examined, and estimates of baseline means and changes over time will be provided. The statistical analysis will consist of descriptive statistics associated with outcome measure (mean change or mean difference pre and post treatment). Means at baseline, 7 and 13/14 weeks, for each outcome, as well as the change over time will be provided, and the corresponding estimates of variability and 95% confidence intervals will be constructed. However, the primary focus for this analysis is to obtain reliable estimates of the mean changes and variability, which will be useful for designing further investigation focused and specifically powered for comparing these outcomes. P-value will be significant if < 0.05. All tests will be two-tailed. The SAS statistical software package version 9.3 (Cary, NC) will be used for all statistical analyses.              Expected outcome:   Given our preliminary data, we do expect MCC/CC and at least QOL to improve. Other secondary outcomes may improve as well. This trial is important since it will allow us to assess the usefulness of oral losartan. However, inhaled losartan is still a possibility if the human trial is negative and the sheep data are promising.	There are ~600 patients in the Southeast FL CF Center Consortium. ~110 of them are on Orkambi and ~20 on Kalydeco. At University of Miami (UoM) and St. Mary's we have 140 adults. We enrolled 29% of our patients at UoM last year in clinical trials, currently mainly available to patients homozygous for F508del (not competing with this trial). Thus, we have a sufficient number of patients for this small trial to be fully enrolled within the proposed 4-year period (4/year).

This study will characterize prognostic and predictive biomarkers and provide a link between these biomarkers and the development of clinically relevant clinical outcomes. The molecular phenotypes de\fned and knowledge acquired will lead to the development of precision medicine strategies targeting therapeutic agents to patients with specifi\fc molecular phenotypes or biomarker patterns.	We plan to enroll 300 ICU pediatric patients with ARDS in a prospective longitudinal cohort and collect biological specimens early in the course of illness, clinical data during hospitalization, and follow up post-discharge data to characterize long-term\nmorbidity among survivors in order to complete the specifi\fc aims outlined in this protocol.	1. Magnitude and trajectory of change in selected markers of inflammation and coagulation pathways such as (sTM and Ang-2) will be associated with increased mortality and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) during hospitalization\nand with markers of long-term morbidity such as persistent O2-dependence and FSS among survivors post discharge.\n\n2. Common and rare genetic variants in the corresponding genes will be associated with biomarker levels and with mortality and multi-organ failure during hospitalization and with long-term morbidity among survivors.	Speci\fc Aim 1.

Respiratory failure solely due to cardiac failure or hydrostatic pulmonary edema (anuric renal failure only requiring fluid removal)	There will be 8 enrolling sites and a central Data Coordinating Center at the University of Utah	\N	We expect enrollment to last 3 years with a year afterward for data analysis and publication.	Subjects will be followed from the time they become eligible to enroll in the study while in the ICU until 9 months later.	\N	Statistical Considerations\n\nDescriptive measures, including proportions, means, standard deviations or medians, and ranges will be utilized as appropriate to pro\fle variables of interest. Normality of distribution will be assessed using QQ plots, and if the assumptions are not met, alternative or nonparametric methods will be used. For genetic data, SNPs that have call rates less than 95% or that are monomorphic will be removed from the analysis. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium will be tested for . Genotype calls will be assessed for any signi\fcant deviations. A signifi\fcance level of 0.05 will be used taking into consideration multiple comparisons.\n\nSpeci\fc Aim Analyses\nSpeci\fc Aim 1. To determine whether plasma levels of coagulation and inflammation-related biomarkers (e.g., sTM and Ang-2) are associated with increased mortality, MODS, and long-term morbidity among survivors and to identify biomarker cut-offs for potential therapeutic trials.\n\nAnalysis plan for specifi\fc aim one.\nRegression models will be used to evaluate the effects of the biomarkers and SNPs on the primary outcome of mortality (logistic regression) and secondary outcomes of morbidity at 1-year (ordinal logistic regression). These models will include terms for clinical covariates as well as markers of interest. Initial evaluation for each marker will construct a model including that marker in addition to the clinical variables. Different formulations of the biomarkers within the models (e.g., baseline, the slope of the biomarker over time) will be considered. [23]\n\nIn order to estimate cut off values for biomarker levels to guide therapy, the Youdin index will be calculated. The Youden index is the sum of the sensitivity and specifi\fcity. For a single biomarker evaluation, we will create the ROC curve and then make a choice about what cutpoint to use. Depending on the intended use of the marker there may be a number of ways to choose the cut-point. A minimum level of the sensitivity or speci\fcity could be decided on and then maximize the other based on that criteria. Maximizing the sum of the sensitivity + speci\fcity (Youden) to get a cut-point that is a bit more\nbalanced and attempts to maximize overall performance will be tried. The CART analysis is a decision tree method that searches for the best possible cut-point for one or more variables at a time. If a single biomarker is put into a CART analysis, it is likely to come up with the same cut-point as using the ROC curve and maximizing the Youden index.\nSpeci\fc Aim 2. To determine whether genetic variants in genes of coagulation and inflammation-related mediators (e.g., sTM and Ang-2) are associated with higher plasma levels of these markers and with mortality, MODS, and long-term morbidity among survivors.\n\nAnalysis plan for specifi\fc aim two.\nRegression models will be used to evaluate the effects of the biomarkers and SNPs on the primary outcome of mortality (logistic regression) and secondary outcomes of morbidity at 1-year (ordinal logistic regression). These models will include terms for clinical covariates as well as markers of interest. Initial evaluation for each marker will construct a model including that marker in addition to the clinical variables. Different formulations of the biomarkers within the models (e.g., baseline, the slope of the biomarker over time) will be considered. [23] For the SNP models, dominant or co-dominant modes\nof inheritance will be considered. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) will be used to adjust for multiple testing for the SNP associations with the outcomes. Finally, multimarker regression models will be constructed including the signi\fcant clinical, biomarker and SNP markers in a single prediction model. AUC will be computed for the logistic model and the c-statistic for the Cox-model to evaluate the overall predictive utility of the markers. 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the effect of model selection on the performance of the prediction models will also be used.\n\nSpeci\fc Aim 3. To test and validate our previously published prognostic inflammation and coagulation-related biomarkers (PAI-1, IL6, IL8, IL10, sTNFr) and published prognostic models such as Latent Class Analysis [26]. We also plan to test additional novel hypotheses related to genomics and biomarkers in ARDS from a rigorously phenotyped cohort with granular clinical data. Analysis plan for specifi\fc aim three. ROC curves will be used to compare the prognostic value of PRISM scores alone with a combined biomarker and PRISM model.\n\nPower Analysis.\nWe plan to enroll 300 subjects. The primary endpoint will be in-hospital mortality. Based on the inclusion criteria we expect 20% of subjects to die during the hospitalization stay. It is expected that at least 100 subjects from the CPCCRN VAP study will be included in this analysis.	The first site is expected to be activated in July 2018.\nWe expect to enroll 300 subjects over 3 years at 8 different sites.  This works out to roughly 1 subject per site per month.\nWe have previously run studies on similar populations and indications within our network and they enroll at similar rates to our projection.\nOur study population is dependent on subjects being admitted to pediatric ICU's.  Our RC's review ICU admissions daily but no active recruiting will take place.

Uber Health, a HIPAA-secure division of Uber Technologies seeks to subcontract with Case Western Reserve University to run a study to determine the impact of shared ride offers on patient health outcomes.  The project is contemplated to involve three parts:  In Part 1, we conduct qualitative interviews with key informants at 3 institutions that are currently using Uber Health. In Part 2, we will request deidentified, aggregated data on use of Uber Health plus claims and EHR data that we will use to determine the study endpoints and calculate sample sizes, resulting in a protocol for the Part 3 study.  In Part 3, we anticipate conducting a cluster-controlled trial of Uber Health in several clinical settings.  We hypothesize that patients in clinics that offer Uber Health rides will show fewer missed visits and better health outcomes than patients in similar clinics that do not offer these rides to patients.  The specific hypotheses and study endpoints for the Part 3 trial will be determined in Part 2.	Pending the results of Parts 1 & 2, we envision that the Part 3 pragmatic trial will compare outcomes in clinics that newly initiate use of Uber Health with similar clinics at the same institutions that do not offer rides.  We will compare pre-post differences in study outcomes between the two arms.	Part 1:  Determine the use cases for Uber Health in three different institutions to hone in on the design and logistics for a pragmatic efficacy study we will conduct in Part III.\n\nPart II:  Prepare a protocol for a pragmatic efficacy trial of offers of free ride-sharing service rides to patients; determine study endpoints, sample sizes, a study timetable and budget based on review of aggregated, de-identified data that we obtain on prior use of Uber Health at several health care institutions, and on health care utilization and health outcomes.\n\nPart III:  Through a Pragmatic Efficacy Trial, determine the effect of offers of free shared rides to patients attending primary care clinics on health outcomes and appropriate health care utilization.  The specific objectives and outcomes will be determined based on the information obtained in Part II.	Part I:  Identification of possible use cases for an efficacy trial.  (For example, this could be: offers of rides to patients with a history of missed visits or to patients newly discharged from the hospital with conditions that have a high 30 day readmission rate.\n\nPart II:  A study protocol, timeline and budget for a Pragmatic Efficacy Trial\n\nPart III:  Primary endpoint TBD in Part II--it may be:  the proportion of patients that miss visits in clinics where rides are offered versus not offered; visits to Emergency Departments or hospital readmissions in these two populations.	1	We will select institutions that currently use Uber Health and are willing to expand Uber Health to clinics within their system.  Patients visiting clinics with newly-initiated Uber Health services will be compared with patients attending clinics that do not currently use Uber Health and are not planning to initiate use during the 3-4 months of the study.  The challenge will be to ensure that clinics in the treatment and control arms have comparable endpoints at the start of the study.  The specific criteria for offers of Uber Health rides, e.g. missed 2+ visits in prior year, will be determined from the key informant interviews in Part 1 and the review of historical data in Part 2.	This study will be open to U.S. health care institutions that currently offer Uber Health rides and are willing to expand use for the study.  Institutions participating in NODE.Health, the Network of Digital Evidence for Health, run by Dr. Ashish Atreja at the Icahn School at Mt. Sinai, in partnership with Case Western Reserve University are initially contemplated for recruitment but we are open to including CTSA institutions.  At present, we know of at least 4 institutions affiliated with academic health systems that are NODE.Health Members, CTSA recipients, and offer Uber Health (Stanford Hospital, Yale New Haven Health, Georgetown Home Health, and LifeBridge/Johns Hopkins.)  We expect to identify other such institutions during Part 1.\n\nIn addition, USC and the University of Colorado health systems offer rides through Lyft.  \n\nAlso, Adams Clinical, a Watertown, MA CRO, uses Uber Health for transporting patients for clinical trials.	Health systems operate a Dashboard through which they can order an Uber ride for patients at risk of missed visits due to lack of transportation, or at risk of having a health problem associated with lack of transportation.  Data in the Dashboard are HIPAA secure and Uber Health drivers do not learn any information about patients other than the pickup and dropoff addresses.  Patients do not need to have or use smartphones to receive the rides.  Health systems pay for the rides.  More than 100 health systems in the country signed up to offer Uber Health during their pilot phase that began July 2017.	Part 1 (Key informant interviewsw) 2 months\nPart 2, protocol design: 2 months\nPart 3, efficacy trial: 5 months	There are no required study visits.  We will collect aggregate data on all patient visits to certain clinics for a period that we estimate to last 3-4 months.  The duration will depend on the frequency of endpoints that we identify in Part 2.	Uber Health is funding NODE Health to run this study.  NODE Health is contracting with Case Western Reserve University for  time of Dr. Sheon to serve as the overall project PI.	This will be defined during Part 2; we seek assistance from the TIN.	In this case, enrollment is of health care systems that use Uber Health.  We have already identified several health systems interested in participating in the trial.  Deidentified data will be provided for all patients attending designated clinics at these institutions.  Patient informed consent will not likely be needed so enrollment is just at the health system level.
237	2017-12-01	5	\N	\N	Engaging Parents of Children with Sickle Cell Anemia and their Providers in Shared-Decision Making for Hydroxyurea (ENGAGE HU)	ENGAGE HU	4	The current study compares two methods for disseminating hydroxyurea guidelines and facilitating shared decision-making: the American Society of Hematology's hydroxyurea clinician pocket guide (usual care method) and a clinician hydroxyurea shared decision-making toolkit (H-SDM toolkit). Eligible children must be between the ages of 0 and 5 and a candidate for hydroxyurea to participate. TThis study will be a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a stepped wedge design, each clinic begins to enroll patients using the usual care dissemination method. Then, each cluster, one-by-one, crosses over to using the H-SDM toolkit dissemination method (one cluster will crossover every 6 months).  We hypothesized: 1) Compared to usual care (clinician pocket guide), the H-SDM toolkit dissemination method will result in an increase in the use of a shared decision making process for hydroxyurea, and parents feeling less uncertain in their decision about hydroxyurea; and 2) Compared to usual care (clinician pocket guide), the H-SDM toolkit dissemination method will result in parents of children with SCD 0-5 years of age knowing more about hydroxyurea, more children offered and receiving hydroxyurea, and these children experiencing positive health outcomes.	The purpose of the study is to answer the following research question: will use of the hydroxyurea shared decision making toolkit (H-SDM toolkit) dissemination method be more effective than the ASH clinician pocket guide dissemination method (usual care) at increasing clinicians' ability to implement sickle cell specific evidence-based guidelines and improve/maintain patient-centered health outcomes? This study will be a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a stepped wedge design, each clinic begins to enroll patients using the usual care dissemination method. Then, each cluster, one-by-one, crosses over to using the H-SDM toolkit dissemination method (one cluster will crossover every 6 months).  Training for the H-SDM toolkit will begin during the last month of the Usual Care period for each cluster. Each cluster will enroll approximately 7-9 participants per time period. Enrollment will end 27 months after study initiation. \nA total of 260 participants (parents of young children with SCD) will be enrolled and complete measures at baseline, and 4-6 months later in-person or online via REDCap. Data on clinician offering of hydroxyurea, hydroxyurea uptake and healthcare utilization will be collected throughout the study. Fidelity will be assessed using a checklist and by reviewing audio recordings of clinic visits (20% of visits).	Primary objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of the usual care dissemination method (clinician pocket guide) and the H-SDM toolkit dissemination method on: parent decisional uncertainty  about hydroxyurea (primary outcome chosen by parents of children with SCD and parent report of shared decision making when talking with their child's clinician about hydroxyurea.   \n\nSecondary objectives: Evaluate the effectiveness of the usual care dissemination method (clinician pocket guide) and the H-SDM toolkit dissemination method on: 1) parent knowledge of hydroxyurea; 2) children offered hydroxyurea; 3) hydroxyurea uptake (children with an active hydroxyurea prescription); and 4) child health outcomes: pain, neurocognitive functioning, sickle cell related quality of life and healthcare utilization.	Primary endpoints: 1) Parent reported decisional uncertainty, and 2) Parent reported perception of shared decision-making. Secondary endpoints: 1) parent knowledge of hydroxyurea; 2) children offered hydroxyurea; 3) children with an active hydroxyurea prescription; and 4) child health outcomes: pain, neurocognitive functioning, sickle cell related quality of life and healthcare utilization.	2	Inclusion Criteria\n1.\tDiagnosis: sickle cell disease\n2.\tAge: birth-5 years, inclusive\n3.\tEligible for hydroxyurea (genotype SS, Sβ0Thal or other genotype + clinical complications)\n4.\tChild's parent, legal guardian, or designated decision maker (caregiver) must participate in both study visits\n5.\tChild's parent, legal guardian, or designated decision maker (caregiver) must able to read, understand, and speak English\n\nExclusion Criteria\n1.\t Parent/legal guardian has previously been approached OR made a decision about whether to initiate Hydroxyurea.\n2.\tAny and all other diagnoses or conditions which, in the opinion of the site investigator or hematologist, would prevent the patient from being a suitable candidate for the study.	We chose SCD clinics with patient volumes from 150-1000 and across geographic regions of the United States (west, south, northeast, midwest) to increase sample representativeness.	Usual Care: In this condition, sites will provide current guidelines for offering hydroxyurea and use the American Society of Hematology (ASH) pocket guide as a reference. ASH developed 'The Hydroxyurea and Transfusion Therapy for the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease' clinician pocket guide based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Evidence Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease: Expert Panel Report, 2014.' The pocket guide recommends use of shared decision making. \n\nHydroxyurea shared decision making toolkit (H-SDM toolkit): During the H-SDM toolkit condition, sites will develop methods for identifying Eligible Patients & Monitoring Progress, have the opportunity to use Implementation Tools, and will use the Visit Decision Aids. The H-SDM toolkit has four visit decision aids to support parents in their decision about hydroxyurea: pre-visit brochure, in-visit issue card, after-visit booklet and video narratives {videos of parents telling their story about how they made a decision about hydroxyurea).	The project will begin in December 2017 and will last until November 2020. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for 4-6 months.	Participants will be enrolled in the study for up to 7 months (baseline visit and follow-up visit 4-6 months later).	This study is being funded by a contract from PCORI: PCORI CDR_1609_36055.	The data will be analyzed based on the intent-to-treat principle. All patients will remain in the arm of the study to which they were randomized, regardless of whether or not they receive the assigned dissemination method. Missing data will be handled using multiple group multiple imputation (with M = 100 imputed datasets) (Cox, Smith, Brown, & Fitzpatrick, 2009) consistent with currently accepted methodological practice. (Godin, Bélanger-Gravel, Eccles, & Grimshaw, 2008).  Aim1: Data from all participants at all time-points will be aggregated within treatment group assignment and analyzed as such. Intervention groups will be compared on baseline characteristics, including demographics and laboratory measurements, using descriptive statistics. Specifically, for Aim 1, each of the M = 100 imputed data sets will be analyzed testing for significant DCS and Dyadic Option mean differences between Toolkit and Usual care groups using two specific a-priori analytic techniques: 1.) All predictor and both response variables will be group-mean centered (using the site-specific mean) prior to analysis to address nesting (non-independence) within site by reducing each variable's ICC to zero, and 2.) parameter estimate constraints in multiple-group SEM will ensure that the assumption of homogeneity of covariate regression slopes is met when controlling for the influence of parent age, parent health literacy, participant gender, participant age, disease severity, and SES on DCS and Dyadic Option means between groups. Aim 2: The secondary outcomes of hydroxyurea knowledge and child reported health outcomes will be evaluated using similar methods to eliminate site level variance prior to data analysis.  Specifically, we will analyze response variables (hydroxyurea offered, hydroxyurea uptake) as binary categorical and convert parameter estimates to odd ratios for interpretation. Specifically, for part one of Aim 2, simple logistic regression analyses will be performed on each of the M = 100 imputed datasets to determine significant differences between Toolkit and Usual Care after controlling for the covariates listed in Aim 1. For part 2 of Aim 2, multiple-group SEM with covariates, as outlined in Aim 1 above, will be used to test for significant group differences in hydroxyurea knowledge, PEDS-QL sickle cell disease (SCD), Ages & Stages, Health Literacy, fetal hemoglobin levels and ANC. For the third part of Aim 2, healthcare utilization variables (number of hospitalizations, ill visits, and emergency room visits) will be analyzed as count variables and examined in exploratory analyses. ER visits, hospitalizations, and ill visits count differences will be assessed with count variable analyses that first determine whether Poisson or negative binomial count distribution analyses are needed prior to testing for significant Toolkit versus Usual Care mean rate differences. We will also conduct process improvement, senstivity (subgroup) and fidelity analyses.	Enrollment is scheduled to begin in March 2017 (all sites will begin active recruitment by May 2017). Each site will enroll 1-2 patients per month for 4 time periods (each time period is 6 months in length). Enrollment will be completed 27 months after the study begins. This estimate is based on prior multisite studies in SCD with more invasive procedures (e.g. neuroimaging).Recruitment and retention are crucial to the successful completion of this trial.

184	2016-08-01	80	\N	\N	Demonstration Project to Develop and Facilitate the Adoption of State-of-the-Art Clinical Trial Performance and Management Metrics	Validation of Baseline Trial Performance Metrics (DEMONSTRATION)	6	Tufts CTSI Research Process Improvement program in conjunction with the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development will follow the NCATS "3Ds" approach.  First will be performed a systematic review and assessment of a broad span of stakeholders of trial performance metrics, including use of the Tufts CSDD clinical trial database.  This will include specific evaluation of metrics such as management variables, such as times from contract, start-up, FPFV, LPLV, and study completion, and other metrics found to be most valuable. This will include developing detailed measures of baseline performance from best performing industry and NIH trials, and specified performance levels.  Following completion of the review, a report will be generated for wide review, comment, input, and potentially to facilitate broad use of state-of-the-art trial performance metrics.  This will then be followed by a demonstration of the application of the metrics in a group of JHU-Tufts clinical trial sites, testing the performance of the performance metrics.  Then for dissemination, the metrics will be made available to other TIC sites for incorporation into their ongoing trials, which will allow more evaluation and feedback, and should provide the platform for uniform common metrics for trial performance across the TICs and the CTSA Consortium.  Not only will this promote assessment and improvement across all sites, it will allow confidence by trial sponsors from NIH ICs, other federal and public entities, and industry, supporting the TICs as the best and most transparent place to do their trials.	None.	1) To systematically review available examples of trial performance metrics and gather stakeholder input; 2) to develop by refining and improving extant metrics standard trial performance metrics; 3) to demonstrate them in a pilot in trials at the JHU-Tufts TIC; and then 4) to disseminate them across all TICs and the CTSA Consortium.	Research process improvement across the Trial Innovation Network will not occur without proven, tested, demonstrated, and disseminated clinical trial performance metrics.  We will follow the pathway for doing this by reviewing extant state-of-the-art, engaging stakeholders, developing best practice trial performance metrics, demonstrating their utility in a pilot set of sites, and then provide them for use across the Trial Innovation Network.	\N	None.

The drug is sodium lactate, which is an FDA approved compound. The FDA product is called Sodium Lactate Injection USP 50 meq (TM) (Hospira), concentration of 5 mq/ml.  The ELI solution is a diluted form of sodium lactate with a concentration of 1.785 meq/ml (200 mg/ml). The three arms will feature different infusion rates to of this dilution to maintain steady state blood lactate concentrations of 1.5-2 mM, 2.1-3.9 mM, and 4-6 mM using a point of care lactate meter (Novanet) to monitor lactate levels and Accucheck to monitor glucose levels every 15 minutes.

156	2017-10-24	7	\N	\N	Fetal therapy for congenital bilateral renal agenesis	Renal Agenesis Fetal Therapy (RAFT)	2	Congenital bilateral renal agenesis (CoBRA) has long been thought to be incompatible with life. After birth the affected neonate not only has renal failure, but also fails to develop functional lungs.  Normal lung development requires amniotic fluid which after the first trimester is due to fetal urine production. The early onset of anhydramnios in fetuses with CoBRA leads to rapid respiratory failure and death in the immediate neonatal period, and thus is associated with 100% mortality.  Case reports suggest that it is possible to safely perform serial amnioinfusions in pregnancies complicated by anhydramnios secondary to CoBRA. Several of the treated fetuses have survived, undergone peritoneal dialysis and eventually received a kidney transplant. The goal of this research is to determine whether serial amnioinfusions can reliably rescue postnatal lung function in fetuses diagnosed with CoBRA. CoBRA occurs in 1 in 3000 pregnancies and there are no reported survivors in untreated patients.  We hypothesize that serial amnioinfusions of replacement amniotic fluid in patients with CoBRA is safe and feasible, and that this therapy will reliably lead to survival and successful postnatal dialysis	The goal of this clinical trial - which represents the first ever such trial performed in humans -  is to test a novel strategy for the rescue of respiratory function in children who have been diagnosed antenatally with CoBRA. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of serial amnioinfusion to reliably prevent pulmonary hypoplasia in patients with isolated CoBRA. It is unknown if serial amnioinfusions can reliably prevent pulmonary hypoplasia in the setting of CoBRA.  Similarly, it is not known if serial amnioinfusions will give neonates enough pulmonary reserve to be candidates for renal replacement therapy with acceptable levels of morbidity. We hypothesize that serial amnioinfusions of normal saline will reliably prevent lethal pulmonary hypoplasia in fetuses diagnosed with CoBRA with minimal maternal morbidity.  Furthermore, we hypothesize that greater than 50% of treated patients will be candidates for dialysis and eventual transplant. This research is of critical importance to determine the efficacy of RAFT and provide guidance for patients and physicians dealing with CoBRA. We will test these hypotheses in the following specific aims; we aim 1) to determine the maternal safety and feasibility serial amnioinfusions in CoBRA 2) to determine the efficacy of serial amnioinfusions to rescue neonatal lung function and 3) to determine the quality of life for patients and families in which the RAFT is successful\n\nWe propose to establish a prospective cohort multi-center study ofl patients who carry a fetus with isolated CoBRA including women who decline termination and elect expectant or invasive treatment. Within this cohort we will apply strict criteria for intervention that are based on standardized accepted criteria.  By applying uniform prospective case, characterization to all patients we will be able to uncover information that is generalizable to this population. We will evaluate maternal safety and feasibility of serial amnioinfusions for RAFT. Furthermore, we will determine the efficacy of serial amnioinfusion in preventing lethal pulmonary hypoplasia in these infants.  We will also establish a baseline natural history for untreated CoBRA patients.  We plan to recruit 60 mother/fetus pairs into the trial.  \n\nEnrollment Criteria\nEnrollment in the study will require confirmation of an isolated CoBRA diagnosis and confirmation that the participant does not wish to undergo termination. This diagnosis can be made as early as 16 weeks gestation age (GA) when amniotic fluid is no longer derived from a maternal transplacental source but rather from fetal urine production.  After a patient is referred to one of our study centers, the diagnosis of isolated CoBRA will be confirmed in the following way: \n\n1)\tAnhydramnios in the absence of ruptured membranes on    \n          ultrasound imaging \n2)\tNo demonstrated kidneys on grey scale on ultrasound   \n          imaging \n3)\tNo demonstrated renal vessels on color Doppler, B flow     \n          and power Doppler imaging \n4)\tNo visualized bladder filling on ultrasound imaging \n\nAs part of routine care the mother will undergo a diagnostic amnioinfusion at this stage to enable a detailed sonographic fetal evaluation to look for extra-renal anomalies. Other significant anomalies will make the patient ineligible for enrollment. Approximately one week after this visit, the mother will return per routine for a follow-up ultrasound.  Confirmation of the diagnosis will be made by complete loss of infused fluid without rupture of membranes and again demonstration of diagnostic criteria 2-4.  After confirmation of the diagnosis, the following inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied to the candidates:\n\n\nInclusion criteria: \n1)\tConfirmed diagnosis of isolated bilateral renal agenesis as outlined in study procedures\n2)\tConfirmation that the expectant mother does not wish to undergo termination of pregnancy  \n3)\tNormal karyotype, and any comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) if performed \n4)\tAge greater than 18 for expectant mothers\n5)\tWillingness to be followed and deliver at study center\n6)\tWillingness for postnatal care to be performed at study center\n7)\tWillingness to have a child in the study until four year after transplantation\n8)\tCompleted consults with pediatric nephrology, neonatology, transplant surgery, pediatric surgery, social worker and maternal fetal medicine \n\nExclusion criteria:\n1)\tCervix less than 2.5 cm in length\n2)\tEvidence of chorioamnionitis\n3)\tEvidence of rupture of membranes or chorioamniotic separation\n4)\tEvidence of preterm labor\n5)\tMultiple gestation pregnancy\n6)\tSevere maternal medical condition in pregnancy.\n7)\tMaternal depression as assessed by a Beck Depression Inventory score equal to or greater than 17\n8)\tTechnical limitations precluding amnioinfusion\n\nIntervention Arm\nFor those patients who are eligible and wish to join the study, the options of expectant management or serial amnioinfusions will be offered.  Counseling provided by pediatric nephrologists, surgeons, transplant surgeons, urologists, social workers, and maternal fetal medicine specialists will take place in a nondirective and supportive environment.  After counseling, patients who are greater than 20 weeks GA but less than 26 weeks GA who wish to continue the pregnancy and undergo intervention will be eligible for intervention; they will return every 7-9 days for amnioinfusions with normal saline until 32 weeks GA. After 32 weeks GA, the fetal therapist will determine the risk/benefit ratio of further infusions in light of the likelihood of inducing preterm labor. The amnioinfusion will be performed under local anesthesia with a 22 or 20 gauged needle as guided by the clinical picture.  The maximal flow rates will be dependent on needle gauge and may take up to one hour.  The volume of the infusate will go up gradually with the size of the fetus. Previous trials that have involved the use of serial amnioinfusion have infused up to 1.5 liters of fluid if it was tolerated in order to minimize the number of procedures.15  Larger volume infusions decrease the need for more frequent infusions and also increase the probability of residual fluid being present at the next opportunity for amnioinfusion.  This residual fluid provides a target and makes amnioinfusion easier.  We plan to utilize this same strategy and will aim for a deepest vertical pocket of 10 after each infusion.  Each amnioinfusion has an approximately 1-2% rate of premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM).  Importantly, emnrolled mothers may withdraw from the intervention arm (or the study entirely) at any time. \n\nExpectant Management Arm\nThose participants who, after the counseling offered above, wish to continue the pregnancy but do not wish to undergo intervention will undergo ultrasounds and monitoring every 1-2 weeks. They will also receive standard of care maternal steroid therapy. \n\nPostnatal Care\nRoutine postnatal care for both groups will occur in the delivery room and NICU including ventilator support for patients who opt for and against RAFT.  Viability of the neonate after birth will not be determined by study team members, but rather by the independent neonatal team. Dialysis will be initiated or withheld per established NICU and nephrology guidelines for dialysis in the setting of respiratory support. We plan to follow surviving fetuses until four years of age after they have undergone kidney transplantation.  All newborns will be enrolled National American Pediatric Renal Trial Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) registry.  \n\n\nData Collection\nPrenatal: Biometric data will be collected on each mother/fetus pair at every prenatal ultrasound visit.  These data will include the amniotic fluid index (AFI), deepest vertical pocket (DVP), cervix length, estimated fetal weight, umbilical artery and vein waveforms. For patients undergoing RAFT additional data will be collected for each procedure including length of procedure, amount of fluid infused, rate of fluid infusion, adverse events during infusion, post-procedure AFI, DVP and cervical length. An intrauterine fetal demise will be recorded. In order to test the hypothesis in Aim 1, major and minor complications will be recorded.  Major complications be defined as fetal death, prematurity < 30 weeks GA, chorioamnionitis, placental abruption, maternal bleeding requiring a blood transfusion, and uterine rupture.  Minor complications will be defined as local wound infection requiring antibiotics, narcotic pain treatment for > 1 day, fetal injury and amniotic band syndrome\n\nPerinatal: Gestational age at delivery, delivery mode, Apgars, and umbilical cord blood gases will be recorded.  \n\nEarly Postnatal:  First arterial blood gas, ventilator support and settings, and use of nitric oxide will be recorded.  Procedures to initiate dialysis and their success will be recorded (peritoneal or hemo). Episodes of sepsis will be recorded as defined by blood culture positivity. Episodes of peritonitis will also be defined as antibiotics started for an intra-abdominal infection. Need for a gastrostomy tube, tunneled central line and tracheostomy will be recorded. Neurologic injury or dysfunction will be recorded. Medications at discharge, respiratory support at discharge and nutritional support at discharge will be recorded.  Death before discharge will be recorded. Age and weight at discharge will be recorded. Discharge to home or another facility will be noted.  \n\nPost-discharge follow-up: In order to follow the outcomes of these patients in the long-term, we plan to use the infrastructure and data gathering mechanisms of the NAPRTCS registry.  This registry is an ongoing research effort that began in 1987 and includes follow-up on over 20,000 patients.  Greater than 500 pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease, dialysis and renal transplant join the registry each year. There are over 60 active NAPRTCS centers and 100 centers that have data sharing agreements--all of these centers have established protocols for capturing data from pediatric patients with renal failure.  We will ensure that upon discharge all of our patients are offered enrollment in NAPRTCS and arrange for the follow-up to take place at a NAPRTCS center.  NAPRTCS uses an electronic data capture system that allows data to be securely entered and retrieved on the internet.  Validated electronic data forms for each patient visit have been developed.  There are data forms for entry into the registry, each dialysis visit, transplant and follow-up after transplant.  Patient demographic data will be entered at the patient's first outpatient encounter through the entry into the registry form.  This data will include age, race, gender, insurance coverage, maternal and paternal education level, blood type, type of dialysis, and initial dialysis access. Data points collected at each visit include current type of dialysis access, access complications, adverse event reporting including need for hospitalization or new medication, and use of growth hormone. Transplant data forms record date and age of transplant, living versus cadaveric donors, HLA histocompatibility, immunsuppressive regimen, calcineurin trough levels, sirolimus trough levels, concominant drug therapy, days of hospitalization, education level,  graft failure, acute rejection, chronic rejection, renal artery stenosis, infection, malignancy, prior transplants, days of hospitalization, echocardiogram, immunosuppression toxicity, compliance with medications, death from other causes, loss to follow-up. Sample data forms are included in the appendix.  Additional data that will be added to the NAPRTCS forms will be needed for urinary tract reconstruction, number of urinary tract operations, kind of urinary tract reconstruction, urinary continence, need for catheterization, and urostomy.\n\tIn order to evaluate quality of life of CoBRA survivors the validated PEDS QLTM measurement model for the pediatric quality of life inventory will be performed at 3 months intervals for each patient at their follow-up visit in concert with NAPRTCS data acquisition. PEDS QLTM instrument is the premier multilingual tool for assessing quality of life in pediatric patients with chronic disease.16  It takes 4 minutes to administer and has excellent reliability and flexibility. This tool is already being administered by NAPRTCS to all chronic renal failure patients.  We have already arranged to create a contemporaneous control group from within the NAPRTCS registry of patients with neonatal renal failure requiring neonatal dialysis for reasons other than CoBRA as a control group. \nSimilarly, the Parent Stress Inventory, 4th Ed will be administered to the primary caregivers of the patient at follow-up visits.  This instrument is well validated and has been used for caregivers of pediatric patients with severe and chronic medical conditions between 1 month and 12 years of age.17  It takes 20 minutes to administer and we have made arrangements with NAPRTCS to begin administering it to the caregivers of all patients with neonatal renal failure requiring neonatal dialysis.  We will, thus, be able to compare the scores of CoBRA and non-CoBRA patients.	Our primary objectives are to determine the maternal safety and feasibility serial amnioinfusions in CoBRA 2) to determine the efficacy of serial amnioinfusions to rescue neonatal lung function. Our secondary objective is to determine the quality of life for patients and families in which the RAFT is successful.	The primary endpoints of the trial will be maternal complication rate and survival to successful dialysis in patients diagnosed with CoBRA prenatally.  Secondary endpoints will be quality of life of survivors and survival to transplant.	1	After a patient is referred to one of our study centers, the diagnosis of isolated CoBRA will be confirmed in the following way: \n\n1)\tAnhydramnios in the absence of ruptured membranes on    \n          ultrasound imaging \n2)\tNo demonstrated kidneys on grey scale on ultrasound   \n          imaging \n3)\tNo demonstrated renal vessels on color Doppler, B flow     \n          and power Doppler imaging \n4)\tNo visualized bladder filling on ultrasound imaging \n\nAs part of routine care the mother will undergo a diagnostic amnioinfusion at this stage to enable a detailed sonographic fetal evaluation to look for extra-renal anomalies. Other significant anomalies will make the patient ineligible for enrollment. Approximately one week after this visit, the mother will return per routine for a follow-up ultrasound.  Confirmation of the diagnosis will be made by complete loss of infused fluid without rupture of membranes and again demonstration of diagnostic criteria 2-4.  After confirmation of the diagnosis, the following inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied to the candidates:\n\n\nInclusion criteria: \n1)\tConfirmed diagnosis of isolated bilateral renal agenesis as outlined in study procedures\n2)\tConfirmation that the expectant mother does not wish to undergo termination of pregnancy  \n3)\tNormal karyotype, and any comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) if performed \n4)\tAge greater than 18 for expectant mothers\n5)\tWillingness to be followed and deliver at study center\n6)\tWillingness for postnatal care to be performed at study center\n7)\tWillingness to have a child in the study until four year after transplantation\n8)\tCompleted consults with pediatric nephrology, neonatology, transplant surgery, pediatric surgery, social worker and maternal fetal medicine \n\nExclusion criteria:\n1)\tCervix less than 2.5 cm in length\n2)\tEvidence of chorioamnionitis\n3)\tEvidence of rupture of membranes or chorioamniotic separation\n4)\tEvidence of preterm labor\n5)\tMultiple gestation pregnancy\n6)\tSevere maternal medical condition in pregnancy.\n7)\tMaternal depression as assessed by a Beck Depression Inventory score equal to or greater than 17\n8)\tTechnical limitations precluding amnioinfusion	The planned participating sites are the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, The University of California, San Francisco Medical Center and the UT Health Science Center at Houston.  All three of these centers provide the highest level of fetal therapy with excellence in both maternal, fetal, neonatal and pediatric care.  There will be no sites outside of the United States.	For those patients who are eligible and wish to join the study, the options of expectant management or serial amnioinfusions will be offered.  Counseling provided by pediatric nephrologists, surgeons, transplant surgeons, urologists, social workers, and maternal fetal medicine specialists will take place in a nondirective and supportive environment.  After counseling, patients who are greater than 20 weeks GA but less than 26 weeks GA who wish to continue the pregnancy and undergo intervention will be eligible for intervention; they will return every 7-9 days for amnioinfusions with normal saline until 32 weeks GA. After 32 weeks GA, the fetal therapist will determine the risk/benefit ratio of further infusions in light of the likelihood of inducing preterm labor.

Each amnioinfusion has an approximately 1-2% rate of premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM).  Importantly, emnrolled mothers may withdraw from the intervention arm (or the study entirely) at any time	60 months	24 months	\N	Although our experience suggests that there will be an approximately 50% split between those parents eligible for the study that elect RAFT vs. expectant management, we must prepare for an unequal distribution of patients between arms.  We therefore used a two sided Fisher's Exact test to show the power that would be achieved with a total sample size of 60 mother/fetus pairs with variable size of the RAFT and expectant management group.  We ran this analysis 4 times with combinations of RAFT survival to dialysis of 50% and 75% and expectant management survival of 5% and 2%..  With a RAFT survival to dialysis of 50% and expectant management survival to dialysis of 5% a near even distribution of patient in the two arms is required to obtain a power of 80%.  Much more uneven distributions yield a power of greater than 80% in all the other projected survival groups.  We, therefore believe the study is appropriately powered because survival in the expectant management group is expected to be near zero.	\N
430	2018-12-04	40	\N	t	Implementation of Genetic Testing in Rural Healthcare Clinics	Moon Shot	6	Compare the implementation of two strategies/methods for identifying members of a primary care clinic's population who have a family or personal history of cancer and offering high risk individuals to obtain genetic testing for cancer susceptibility mutations. The two methods are 1) Point of Care (POC) approach: a tablet-based screening for family/personal history of cancer will be offered to all patients aged 25-65 coming in for a routine appointment at the clinic.  2) Direct Patient Engagement (DPE):  Letters will be sent to all individuals aged 25-65 in a clinic's population, inviting them to visit a web site for screening for family/personal history of cancer. In both strategies, those determined to be high risk will receive online education about genetic testing and an invitation to obtain such testing through a web-based platform.  POC individuals will complete these activities within the clinic and DPE individuals will complete them at home. Outcomes will be the fraction of the clinic population that completes screening and the fraction of the clinic population that undergoes testing	This grant proposes a randomized trial with a longitudinal follow up design for this mixed methods multilevel project to investigate the processes and structures used to implement cancer risk genomic testing into an existing healthcare system.  It will identify healthcare system based predictors of improvement in the system's adherence to guidelines, the patients' and providers' perceptions of risks and benefits of genetic information, effective methods to communicate these results to motivate action without unintended consequences (over-diagnosis, fatalistic responses, increased stigma), and best clinical flow for genomic screening procedures	Aim 1.  Compare the implementation of two strategies/methods for identifying high risk members of a clinic's population who have a family or personal history of cancer, and encouraging these high risk individuals to obtain genetic testing for cancer susceptibility mutations.\nOutcomes:  The outcomes of Aim 1 are the fraction of the clinic population that participates in the family/personal screening and the fraction of the clinic population that undergoes genetic testing.\nAim 2.\tIdentify changes in clinical flow and activities from before to after the implementation of testing into the healthcare system.\nOutcomes: The outcomes of Aim 2 are the patterns of clinical flow activities represented in clinical flow diagrams drawn for each region.  Each of the arms has potential to alter or disrupt the clinical flow, in different ways.  For the POC arm, interacting with a tablet that takes a brief family history could be discussed in the primary care visit.  For the DPE arm, providers might get questions from patients who are approached at home to screen for testing.\nAim 3. Evaluate the effects of implementation of genomic screening for cancer risk on patient, provider, and health system leader perceived benefits and harms.\nOutcomes:  The outcomes for this aim are the selected relevant benefits and risks of providing testing results to patients.\nAim 4: (Phase 4) Evaluate the value (cost-effectiveness) and affordability (budget impact) of each screening strategy.\nUsing decision analytic techniques and the healthcare system perspective, we will integrate genomic, clinical, and healthcare utilization data to model long-term outcomes associated with each screening strategy. We will also conduct a budget impact analysis. Estimating budget impact is as important as demonstrating overall economic value, so that these and future health-system can carefully evaluate use of their resources\nOutcomes: The metric used to assess the cost-effectiveness is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).The numerator of the ICER contains all relevant costs, while the denominator that specifies the outcome using the metric of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Separately, we will build a budget impact model to estimate health-system resource use associated with each strategy.	Patients: Satisfaction with care, quality of care, familial communication, quality of life\nProviders: Satisfaction with worksite, quality of care, beliefs about genomics\nHealthcare Leaders: Satisfaction with implementation process, quality of care\nBudget impact: incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), quality-adjusted life year (QALY)	1	N=510 (360 patients, 120 providers, 30 healthcare leaders). The patient cohort will be "active" patients in the primary care clinic, per the healthcare system's definition of "active" and aged 25-65 and found eligible for genetic testing for cancer risk, following a screening for familial cancer risk.	Randomization will occur at the clinic level. Two health systems have agreed to join, each contributing six clinics to the study, for a total of 12.	Recruitment will be via point of care screening or letters or emails directly to the patient. Study procedures include electronic risk assessment (surveys), auto-taped interviews, genetic testing by saliva, online education.\nCommon cancer screening tests, such as abnormal cervical cytology (pap smear) test results for patients with positive results.	Accrual period has not been established. Data collection will continue 24 months\npost-enrollment of the 510th participant.	Assessments will occur at baseline, 6 months post implementation, 12 months post implementation and 24 months post implementation.	None to report	Aim 1 Analyses: The two primary outcomes are binary, i.e. whether or not each individual in the clinic population completed screening or genetic testing, and individuals are clustered within clinics.  Therefore the main analyses for this aim will be logistic regression using a mixed model that includes clinic as random effect, and intervention arm as a fixed effect.  Age and sex will also be included as person-level fixed effects. \n\nAim 2 Analyses: We will take a systems approach to map out the clinical flow of the entire sequencing process to understand how patients move through the primary care and follow-up setting.  One important visualization tool is Value Stream Mapping (VSM), a type of flow chart that has been used in manufacturing settings to demonstrate the "lean" management concept [70]. VSM aims to identify waste and inefficiency in the system and provide optimum value to patients and healthcare providers through a value creation process. We will use VSM to identify the timing, duration and resource need at each step of the decision flow, which include scheduling of new tests, method selection, results interpretation, and information sharing with patients. Bottleneck, delays, non-value added time, and other barriers to implementation will be detected during the implementation process as areas of improvement. Another goal is to design standardized processes for incorporating genetic testing into the primary care setting for patients with different baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. A decision-analytic modeling approach will be taken to simulate the clinical flows on the population-aggregate level. This approach includes decision tree and Markov cohort simulation to project the effects of changes from before to after standardized sequencing processes.\n\nAim 3 Analyses: Analyses will consist of multiple regression to predict elements of harms and benefits separately in patients and providers using baseline data and multiple predictors of interest.   Associated with Yij will be a vector xij of covariates for the patient (xij,patient), the provider (xij,provider),  time trends (xij,time), and the environment (xij,environment). We will model the probability of satisfaction, pr(Yij = 1) = E[Yij] = €ij, as a function of the covariates xij using regression as follows:  y(€ij) = xij,Tproviderα +  xij,Tpatientβ + xij,Ttime© + xij,Tenvironment™  Time covariates will be examined as two or four year intervals, as well as linear, quadratic or higher-order polynomials as statistically appropriate. These functions of time represent the diffusion curves. Patients within providers and regions are correlated with each other. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) [71] will take the correlation into account for the regression model. An exchangeable working correlation will be used along with the sandwich variance estimator to provide protection from misspecification of the correlation structure. General software for GEE is available in SAS PROC GENMOD. Interviews will be digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and reviewed by team members to establish familiarity with the data. An initial coding scheme will be developed based on the themes within our theoretical framework and the transcripts themselves. Additional codes will be added as needed. Two members of the research team will independently code each transcript. Coders will meet iteratively to establish inter-coder agreement. Coded data will be iteratively reviewed by the full investigative team in order to identify themes, as well as to select exemplary quotes [7,69].  Differences by arm, by participant race-ethnicity and provider and by patient subgroup for each interview type will be explored.\n\nAim 4 Analyses: To create the cost-effectiveness model, we will employ accepted modeling standards [72,73] . \nUsing decision analytic techniques and the healthcare system perspective, we will integrate genomic, clinical, and healthcare utilization data to model life years gained and QALYs associated with each screening strategy. As model input parameters, we will use data collected from the surveys, electronic health record and the literature. We will use a lifetime time horizon, and will conduct both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. From our probabilistic sensitivity analysis, we will be able to estimate the proportion of simulations that are cost-effective, using as a benchmark the accepted willingness to pay (WTP) threshold for the United States of $150,000 per QALY gained. We will conduct a threshold analysis, which will enable us to vary one or more important input parameters to estimate the requisite change that would cause the WTP threshold to exceed $150,000. We will also conduct a scenario analysis, estimating cost-effectiveness from the patient's perspective, which will include out-of-pocket costs. Separately, we will also conduct a budget impact analysis, using accepted methods [74]. Estimating budget impact is as important as demonstrating overall economic value, so that the health-system can carefully evaluate use of their resources.	If funded, the earliest start date would be September 2019.

The development of small molecules that rescue mutation-specific CFTR function have made remarkable impacts on patient care. Ivacaftor, a CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator and the first small molecule approved by the FDA mainly for class III mutations, has shown incredible improvements in ion transport (sweat chloride), clinical outcome (FEV1 and weight, decrease in exacerbation rates), and quality of life. The second approved medication for patients homozygous for F508del, a combination of a corrector and potentiator (lumacaftor and ivacaftor), had only modest effects on lung function and sweat chloride. One explanation for this less than optimal efficacy in vivo could be ongoing airway and systemic inflammation. In this context, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) decreases the ability of lumacaftor to rescue CFTR function and airway surface liquid (ASL) volume in vitro. TGF-beta also decreases the function of other critically important apical channels that regulate airway surface liquid volume, namely calcium activated chloride channels and BK. We therefore propose that airway inflammation, especially via TGF-beta1, leads to dysfunction of apical ion channels and an inability of lumacaftor to rescue F508del CFTR to the membrane. Clinically used Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) inhibit TGF-beta signaling, independent of their angiotensin receptor blocking ability. Thus, ARBs could present a safe fast track approach for improving the function of apical ion channels and the efficacy of CFTR recovery therapies for F508del homozygous patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The proposed trial will examine the ability of losartan to rescue CFTR function in patients homozygous for F508del and already treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor, potentially identifying a 'low-hanging-fruit' intervention for CF airway inflammation.	The goal of our pilot clinical trial is to examine the ability of losartan on CFTR (primary hypothesis) and possibly BK rescue/augmentation (secondary hypothesis) in patients homozygous for F508del on Orkambi� therapy. The additional benefit for BK channels could be important, but is harder to measure their function in vivo as an endpoint in patients. Towards this end, however, we will assess CaCC/BK activity together as the response to ATP during NPD measurements, even though this is not an accurate reflection of either channel on its own. Notions that CaCC currents in NPD measurements in CF patients are higher than in normal subjects stem from the lack of a negative deflection of PD in CF patients in response to 0 Cl / isoproterenol addition: the total deflection in normal subjects is usually still higher than the total deflection in CF patients. Primary hypothesis: Losartan at 1.4 mg/kg (pediatric) or 100 mg (adult) for 12 weeks will improve CFTR conductance as measured with NPD. We expect that compared to placebo, DNPD in response to 0 Cl-/isoproterenol will change by -4 mV using the most polarized nostril each time. Secondary hypotheses: Losartan 1.4 mg/kg (pediatric) or 100 mg (adult) for 12 weeks will improve BK and CaCC activity as assessed with ATP using NPD and will also reduce nasal cytokine levels and systemic inflammatory markers.       Study plan: 36 patients with CF, > 12 years of age, who are homozygous for F508del and have been on treatment with Orkambi� for at least 3 months will be recruited for this trial. This trial will be randomized 1:1 with placebo (n=18 for each group). After signing informed consent at the screening visit, we will perform spirometry, determine sweat chloride, take blood (see below), and test for pregnancy where applicable. Since losartan has teratogenic effects, we will enforce strict birth control in female participants. Eligible patients will complete visits as outlined below. Quality of life will be assessed by CFQ-R. NPD will use standard protocols and so will nasal cell harvest (see below for assessments). Cytokines will be measured from nasal fluid recovered by Leukosorb filter paper. There will be two visits for these different nasal assessments to assure that nasal cell fluid and cell collection will not influence NPD and vice versa. After assessing baselines, a daily dose of 0.7 mg/kg (pediatric) or 50 mg (adult) losartan or placebo will be started. A safety visit will occur after 7 days of treatment (� 2 days) and the losartan dose (or placebo) increased to 1.4 mg/kg (pediatric) or 100 mg (adult) daily (higher dose is likely needed to get anti-inflammatory effect in airways if present). Since this trial assesses anti-inflammatory effects of losartan (and lack of placebo), the total duration will be 14 weeks to achieve 12 weeks of treatment with losartan (or placebo). If exacerbations occur, the patient will report and come for a sick visit.	The life span of patients with CF continues to be shortened by progressive lung disease. CF can be caused by ~2000 mutations in the CFTR gene. These mutations can be, even though imperfectly, classified into 5 groups, permitting the development of small molecules that rescue group-specific CFTR mutants. These small molecules made remarkable impacts on patients. The CFTR potentiator ivacaftor (Kalydeco�), approved by the FDA mainly for class III mutations, has shown improvements in ion transport (large decrease in sweat chloride), clinical outcome (increase in FEV1 and weight, decrease in exacerbation rates), and quality of life. However, ivacaftor did not immediately eliminate airway inflammation, despite improvement in CFTR conductance, at least not within 12 month. However, airway inflammation is associated with morbidity in CF and additional anti-inflammatory treatment options are needed. F508del, a class II mutation, is the most common mutation in the US CF population. The FDA recently approved Orkambi�, a corrector and potentiator (lumacaftor and ivacaftor), to reduce exacerbations in F508del homozygous patients, even though the effect of Orkambi� on lung function and sweat chloride was modest at best. One explanation for this suboptimal efficacy in vivo could be the ongoing airway inflammation as outlined above. In this context, increased production of TGF-beta1 is common in CF airways and has been associated with worse pulmonary outcome. In particular, TGF-beta1 has been shown to decrease the ability of lumacaftor to rescue CFTR function and airway surface liquid (ASL) volume in vitro. TGF-beta1-associated inflammation also decreases the function of other ion channels important for ASL volume regulation: Calcium activated chloride channels (CaCC) and the apical potassium channel BK. We therefore propose that airway inflammation, especially via TGF-beta1, leads to a lower CaCC and BK activity, worsening mucociliary dysfunction in CF. Previous publications and our own preliminary data, show that clinically used Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) inhibit TGF-beta signaling, independent of their angiotensin receptor blocking ability. Thus, ARBs could present a 'fast track approach' for treating airway inflammation in CF, thereby enhancing the efficacy of lumacaftor for homozygous F508del patients. In fact, our preliminary data show that ARBs re-establish the ability of lumacaftor to correct CFTR function in vitro in CF cells treated with TGF-beta1. We therefore propose to conduct a proof of concept clinical trial to test if administration of losartan augments CFTR function in vivo in patients who are on Orkambi�. While we will concentrate on CFTR function as a primary endpoint, namely that losartan's ability to inhibit TGF-beta signaling will not only augment CFTR conductance rescued by Orkambi� (primary hypothesis), we will also test our secondary hypothesis that losartan rescues other channel functions such as those of CaCC and BK.

For the formal analysis, mixed effects models model will be used for analysis to accommodate the paired measures nature of the design, as well as missing values under the MAR assumption. We will determine the final analytic approach based on the final available data. Examination of baseline differences on key variables between subjects remaining and those lost-to-follow-up will also be conducted. The first set of analyses will not adjust for dropouts. Only cases with complete data will be included.        Secondary endpoints: Prior to analysis, we will investigate the distributional properties of the defined outcome measures - such as CaCC/BK activity, change in sweat chloride concentration, FEV1, changes in serum inflammatory markers, etc. Necessary transformations such as logarithmic or square root will be applied to satisfy normality assumptions if necessary. Baseline values of all variables will be examined, and estimates of baseline means and changes over time will be provided. The statistical analysis will consist of descriptive statistics associated with outcome measure (mean change or mean difference pre and post treatment) for two treatments. Means at baseline, 7 and 13/14 weeks, for each outcome, as well as the change over time will be provided, as well as the corresponding estimates of variability, and 95% confidence intervals will be constructed. t-tests for comparisons of the changes over the period between treatments will be conducted. However, the primary focus for this analysis is to obtain reliable estimates of the mean changes and variability, which will be useful for designing further investigation focused and specifically powered for comparing these outcomes. P-value will be significant if < 0.05. All tests will be two-tailed. The SAS statistical software package version 9.3 (Cary, NC) will be used for all statistical analyses.	There are currently 51 patients (53% male) in the Southeast Florida CF Center consortium that fulfill the inclusion criteria of being treated with Orkambi for >3 months, being >12 years of age and having an FEV1 of >40% predicted. In addition, the centers in Orlando and at the University of FL have pledged help for enrollment if needed; they have a combined additional 34 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria (see letters). In Cincinnati, there are currently 45 eligible patients. In Birmingham, there are additional patients. Historically we had high enrollment success in general (~25% of the general CF population) and expect that we can enroll the required number of patients for this trial, especially counting only on eligible patients.

Phonak (our industry partner) agreed to extend the trial period from 45 days to 120 days to ensure participants have adequate time to complete the study before committing to purchasing 1 or 2 aids.	The proposed study design is a randomized, parallel-group, clinical trial (RCT) with three treatment arms including: (1) a bilateral hearing aid fitting group, (2) a monaural hearing aid fitting group, or (3) a patient choice group for monaural or bilateral hearing aid fitting. This RCT design will allow us to determine whether or not bilateral hearing aids are more beneficial than a monaural hearing aid. In addition, and arguably more important, the inclusion of the patient choice group will allow us to examine real-world treatment conditions (i.e., preference effects) and will likely improve the generalizability of study results	To determine whether bilateral or monaural hearing amplification is most effective for patients with mild to moderate ARHL and if the patient choice affects outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that patients with mild to moderate hearing loss will find bilateral hearing amplification to be most beneficial (primary outcome) and that the benefit obtained from the choice group will be higher for either fitting than the comparator group who received a random assignment of fitting configuration.\nThe expected outcomes of this study are high-quality efficacy and effectiveness evidence supporting either monaural or bilateral hearing aid fittings in this patient population (comparator groups). In addition, the role of patient choice in hearing related outcomes also will be determined (choice group). Finally, the study results will provide evidence to better inform the decisions patients make regarding pursuit of monaural or bilateral hearing aids and offer concrete guidance for clinical practice based on evidence with high internal and external validity.	Final outcome measures will be vetted with the Stakeholder Advisory Team after funding is awarded.\n\nTo determine the patient-centered hearing-aid benefit (primary outcome), and other multi-dimensional outcomes including hearing-related quality of life, hearing aid satisfaction in patient-nominated goals, ecological hearing aid outcomes, and objective hearing-aid outcomes (secondary outcomes) for monaural versus bilateral hearing aid fittings.\nThe overall patient-centered benefit (i.e., improvement between unaided and aided conditions) as determined by the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB)4 and the secondary outcomes including the Hearing Handicap Inventory Elderly (HHIE)5, Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI)6, Speech Spatial and Qualities (SSQ)7, auditory working memory8, and speech-in-noise performance9 will be significantly better for bilateral fittings compared to the monaural fitting groups.	1	INCLUSION\n50+ years of age\nMild to moderate, symmetrical SNHL (symmetrical: <20dB between ears from 500-4000Hz)\nOpen-mindedness to monaural or bilateral option after being recommended amplification\nNo prior hearing aid experience\nAdequate literacy to complete questionnaires\nWilling to purchase study-specific hearing aid(s)\n\nEXCLUSION\nConcerns for middle ear pathology\nConcerns for retrocochlear pathology\nSevere tinnitus as the reason for seeking amplification\nCo-morbid condition that would interfere with study (e.g., dementia, blindness, neurologic pathology)\nHistory of fluctuating hearing loss	Duke and Vanderbilt	Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio via a random-number generator. The monaural fitting group will be further assigned the ear in which the hearing aid will be fitted also with a 1:1 ratio. The study hearing aid(s) will be ordered from Phonak after the group assignments	3 years	4-6 months	\N	Analytic Plan for Specific Aim 2: Group characteristic and baseline (unaided) measures will be compared to ensure group equivalency.  Any variables identified as significantly different among the groups will be used as covariates in the analyses. Otherwise, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) will be used to identify if treatment group is predictive of scores on the behavioral and self-report questionnaires. The primary outcome of hearing-aid benefit as measured with improvement on the unaided versus aided APHAB will be evaluated with a GLMM approach with group (bilateral, monaural, choice) as the between-subjects factor and the visit (unaided, aided post-intervention) as the within-subjects factor. Mauchley's test will be conducted to ensure model assumptions were met, and if not, Greenhouse-Geisser corrections will be used. The significance level will be set to p < 0.05. Post-hoc testing will be conducted on any significant findings and Bonferroni corrections (or others types of corrections as appropriate) will be used. Effect sizes will be determined with partial eta squared calculations. This methodology will be repeated for the secondary outcome measures for those with unaided (pre-intervention visit) and aided (post-intervention visit). Otherwise, for measures with a post-only score (e.g., IOI-HA, if included per the Stakeholder Advisory Team), a simple analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed with group as the between-subjects variable. Non-parametric analyses will be performed with the COSI measure to compare if the proportion of categorical responses for satisfaction and benefit for patient-nominated goals were different amongst the treatment groups. The results from these analyses will allow us to also determine if the outcomes in the choice group were significantly different than the other groups (Hypothesis 2b). Independent baseline predictors of outcome will be identified using univariable logistic regression models. A multivariable logistic regression model will then be used to identify variables in combination that accurately predict outcome should group differences be found.	Potential patients will be recruited primarily from audiology clinics (Drs. Ricketts and Dillon-audiology stakeholders), but we will also recruit from Primary Care with the support of Dr. Dolor (Primary Care stakeholder), Dr. Francis (Otolaryngology stakeholder) and through advertisements at each site. Dr. Whitson, Director of the Duke CTSI's Special Populations Core, has agreed to provide the study team guidance on recruitment tactics of this population. Jamie Roberts, Director of the Recruitment Innovation Center in the Duke CTSI, has also agreed to provide tools and resources for recruiting at Duke. \nThe study has a comprehensive Stakeholder Engagement Plan and has identified most of the stakeholders needed to support a patient-centered study, including the design and selection of outcome measures, patient-facing materials, and dissemination plans.\n\nCohort analysis for feasibility was carried out using PCORnet to identify the number of potentially eligible subjects at Duke and Vanderbilt.
440	2019-01-23	20	\N	f	Optimizing Smoking Cessation within the Context of Lung Cancer Screening	Smoking Cessation & Lung Cancer Screening	6	The overall objective of this protocol is to test the efficacy of 3 increasingly intensive and increasingly more integrated smoking cessation treatment strategies initiated in the context of  low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening. This protocol focuses on the comparative efficacy and cost effectiveness of 3 existing modalities for the delivery of a cessation counseling intervention: a publicly available quitline (Arm 1); level of involvement of LDCT medical providers (Arm 2); and integration of smoking cessation specialists within the LDCT setting (Arm 3).  \n\nThe central hypothesis is that treatment intensity and integration will predict abstinence, such that the most intensive and integrated treatment will result in the highest abstinence rates (Integrated Care (IC)>Quit Line (QL Plus>QL) 6-months after treatment. Our secondary hypotheses are that IC will be the most cost-effective treatment and will result in the highest abstinence rates among smokers with current mental health conditions (MHC).	The overall objective of this protocol is to test the efficacy of 3 increasingly intensive and increasingly more integrated smoking cessation treatment strategies initiated in the context of  low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening. \n\n630 Participants will be randomly assigned (within 30 days of their Low Dose CT scan) to one of 3 arms; the Quit Line (QL), QL Plus and IC conditions using a form of adaptive randomization called minimization which balances groups throughout enrollment, based on gender, age, ethnicity, cigarettes/day and presence of a mental health condition.	The objectives are:\n\n1.   Primary Objective: \n\tA.   Evaluate the efficacy of 3 smoking cessation treatment strategies of increasing intensity and integration (IC> QL Plus>QL) offered at the LDCT lung cancer screening visit to all smokers.\n\n2.   Secondary Objective:\n\tA.   Evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of QL versus QL Plus versus IC and assess the value of implementation of scaling up the most cost-effective smoking cessation treatment strategy. (Secondary 1)\n\tB.   Assess the moderating influence of mental health conditions (MHC) on treatment outcome. (Secondary 2)\n\tC.  Assess the effects of treatment on hypothesized treatment mechanisms (e.g., motivation, agency/self-efficacy, stress/negative affect) and the role of those mechanisms in mediating the effect of treatment on abstinence. (Secondary 3)	Two commonly used effectiveness measures in cost-effectiveness studies of smoking cessation interventions are the number of quitters and years of life saved (YOLS).To facilitate comparisons with published studies, we will add quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The number of quitters in each treatment arm will be retrieved directly from the primary abstinence endpoint at Month 6.	1	Eligibility Criteria\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n•\tAge: 50 or older \n•\tMeets guidelines for lung cancer screening, as determined by radiology team\n•\tReports being a daily or non-daily smoker (any self-reported smoking in the past 30 days) and is interested in treatment that might change smoking behavior.\n•\tAble to follow verbal and written instructions in English and complete all aspects of the study.\n•\tProvide informed consent and agree to all assessments and study procedures.\n•\tHave an address and telephone number where he/she may be reached.\n•\tBe the only participant in his/her household on active treatment in Protocol 2016-0626 at the time.\n•\tWilling and able to undergo low dose CT scan, as determined by radiology team, or has had a lung cancer screen within 30 days prior to enrollment into this protocol.\nExclusion Criteria:\n•\tCurrent enrollment or plans to enroll in another smoking cessation program in the next 9 months.\n•\tUnwilling to refrain from other nicotine substitutes use (i.e., OTC or prescription medication for smoking cessation) or smoking cessation treatments over the next 9 months. \n•\tCurrent use of certain medications: (1) Smoking cessation meds (last 7 days), i.e., Wellbutrin, Bupropion, Zyban, NRT, Chantix.\n•\tA positive urine pregnancy test during the screening period.

Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches, implants or injections), (2) barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or (3) an intrauterine device (IUD). Contraceptive measures sold for emergency use after unprotected sex are not acceptable methods for routine use.\n•\tExclusive use of tobacco products other than cigarettes, such as (but not limited to) cigars, chew, snuff, pipe or e-cigs.	Currently, we have limited the sites to MD Anderson in the Texas Medical Center. Efforts to expand recruitment sites are ongoing in hopes to expand to the UT system.	QL. The quitline intervention used in this study is modeled after the Texas Quitline delivered by Alere Wellbeing, Inc. (Optum). Participants receive up to five proactive counseling calls, scheduled at convenient times and at relapse-sensitive intervals, up to 50 days post-quit. Participants can also call a 1-800 number for additional support between proactive calls. \n\nQL Plus Intervention.  The QL Plus intervention will consist of treatment elements in the QL intervention with the addition of a discussion between an LDCT medical provider and screening patient regarding options for pharmacotherapy.  At the conclusion of this conversation, the patient will be provided with an initial supply of the medication jointly decided between provider and patient. \n\nIntegrated Care (IC) Intervention.  The IC intervention will consist of all common treatment elements but instead of an electronic referral to the quitline, a warm handoff will be made to MD Anderson TTP staff who will discuss the TTP program with the patient and arrange a consult with TTP smoking cessation specialists (counselor and medical provider) that day.\nThe TTP program is a guideline based combination9 of motivation and problem-solving approaches that initially provides 4-8 counseling sessions and pharmacotherapy over a 10-12 week period, with a provision for additional sessions if clinically warranted. Counseling sessions are approximately 30 minutes in duration and are scheduled in accordance with patient preferences and situations that may adversely affect success. As in the QL Plus group, at the conclusion of the consult, the patient is provided with an initial supply of medication jointly decided between provider and patient. \n\nPharmacotherapy.  \nIn this study the option to use the nicotine patch (if appropriate) will be extended to smokers in the QL only condition, as is the typical practice of most quitlines. Subjects randomized to the QL Plus or the IC groups will potentially be provided with an oral prescription medication (varenicline or bupropion) or OTC NRT (patch, lozenge, gun or combination) if appropriate, based on the provider's clinical decision and the subject's preference. Medications are provided without charge, consistent with the expectation that cessation medications be a covered benefit in the Affordable Care Act. All medication options are FDA approved for smoking cessation. All MDACC providers will be trained via educational materials and information leaflets to provide evidence based tobacco cessation treatment. In all groups, medication will be provided in 4 week installments for up to 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy contingent upon on at least one contact with the quitline or IC provider in the preceding interval. This is a common standard for continued medication use in most state run quitlines. For IC patients who manage to quit during the study period, and who express interest, additional pharmacotherapy can be recommended for additional 3 months for relapse prevention. If the patient is using a prescription medication, the provider may issue a prescription to be filled independently at their community pharmacy.	Estimated time from the opening of enrollment to completion of data analyses is 60 months.	Participants will complete their participation in approximately 6-months.	No disclosures or conflicts to report.	Given recommendations that all clinical trials be analyzed in conventional, Frequentist and Bayesian fashion, parallel analyses using both approaches will be conducted for Primary Objective and Secondary Objective 2 and 3. Frequentist results yield the probability of the observed data, or data more extreme, given that the null hypothesis holds.  Bayesian results yield the probability that the governing parameter for an observed process equals some value or range of values.  This permits statements regarding the probability that treatment confers benefit of some magnitude. Statistical analyses will use SAS v.9.3.  Continuous and dichotomous data will utilize linear and logistic regression, respectively (Proc GENMOD; SAS v. 9.3).  Longitudinal analyses will employ generalized linear mixed models (Proc MIXED, Proc GLIMMIX and Proc MCMC; SAS 9.3) using maximum likelihood estimation. This approach is robust to data missing at random. Pattern-mixture modeling will address non-ignorable missing data patterns 83.  Sensitivity analyses will evaluate robustness to missing data assumptions.\nFor Bayesian analyses, unless otherwise indicated in the data analytic plan, priors will be neutral and diffuse.  For linear and logistic regression, priors for coefficients will take the form ~N (mean = 0, var = 1 x 106) in the linear and log (odds) scales respectively.  Priors for error or dispersion terms will use ~Inverse Gamma (shape = 0.001, scale = 0.001).  Choice of prior distribution for level two (i.e. random effect) variances will follow recommendations by Gelman.  Sensitivity analysis using optimistic and pessimistic, skeptical priors will evaluate prior assumptions. Evaluation of posterior distributions will permit statements regarding the probability that effects of varying magnitudes exist, given the data.\n\n\nStatistical power will focus on our primary objective. Power/sample size calculations assumes 20% attrition from the initial sample (N = 630), modeled in ITT analyses as non-abstinent.  Anticipated effect sizes are calculated from reported ITT findings that use the same approach for missing outcomes.    Based on data from the TTP at MD Anderson (see preliminary studies), and meta-analysis of quitline data86, we estimate 6 month abstinence rates for the IC and QL conditions to be 36% and 11% respectively.  We estimate that 20% of QL Plus participants will not follow-up with their LDCT medical provider for additional pharmacotherapy, while 40% will continue using NRT and 40% will continue using varenicline treatment.  Assuming, that the best case scenario for those not following-up with their LDCT provider is to achieve QL rates of abstinence (11%), and that those receiving NRT or varenicline will achieve maximum 6-month abstinence rates of 22% and 24% respectively, noted in recent meta-analysis of these medications,20 we anticipate that the overall six month abstinence rate will likely not exceed 0.2*0.11 + 0.4*0.22 + 0.4*0.24 = 0.21.  Given the uncertainty inherent in the estimate of QL Plus, however, Table 1 provides power estimates for a range of effect sizes.	The study opened for recruitment 10 months after receiving the Notice of Award.  We have been actively recruiting since July 2017 (18 recruiting months as of January 1, 2019).
409	2018-11-05	7	\N	t	Trial of Oral Doxycycline for the Treatment of Childhood Lyme Meningitis	Lyme Meningitis Trial	4	Specific Aim 1 (Treatment efficacy and effectiveness): To test for non-inferiority of oral doxycycline relative to IV ceftriaxone for resolution of symptoms with Lyme meningitis. This study will test the primary hypotheses that oral doxycycline is non-inferior to IV ceftriaxone for resolution of Lyme meningitis symptoms at 6 weeks.\n\nSpecific Aim 2 (CSF Predictors of treatment effect): To collect CSF from all treated children to evaluate markers of infection that predict treatment effect and facilitate diagnosis. We hypothesize that in Lyme neuroborreliosis a small number of organisms triggers a vigorous immune response and that greater CSF inflammation is associated with higher rates of treatment failure.	Title: Trial of Oral Doxycycline for the Treatment of Childhood Lyme Meningitis\n\nPrécis: This is a hybrid trial using an RCT concurrently with a clinician-choice observational study to compare oral doxycycline to IV ceftriaxone to treat children with Lyme meningitis.\n\nObjectives: Primary hypothesis: Oral doxycycline is non-inferior to IV ceftriaxone for resolution of Lyme meningitis symptoms at 6 weeks. Secondary hypotheses: 1) Oral doxycycline is non-inferior to IV ceftriaxone for resolution of cranial neuritis at 6 weeks, 2) Oral doxycycline is non-inferior to IV ceftriaxone for quality of life at 6 months, 3) Oral doxycycline is associated with fewer adverse events than IV ceftriaxone and 4) Oral doxycycline is more cost effective than IV ceftriaxone.\n\nEndpoint: Six months after enrollment\n\nPopulation: Children age < 22 years with Lyme meningitis\n\nPhase: III\n\nNumber of Sites:\t25 (14 trial and 11 observational only)\n\nStudy Agents: Oral doxycycline (4 mg/kg up to 100 mg) twice per day versus IV Ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg up to 2 g) once per day\n\nStudy Duration: 7 years\n\nParticipant Duration: 6 months\n\nAllocation of participants: At 13 Trial sites, eligible patients will be randomized if they consent to trial participation. If they do not consent to trial they will be asked to consent to longitudinal data collection (same outcomes as trial) with treatment decided by clinician choice. At non-trial sites, eligible patients will be asked to consent to longitudinal data collection with treatment decided by clinician choice.\n\nBlinding: Single blinding of outcome assessor only\n\nBiospecimens: paired CSF and serum samples	Primary Objective: Oral doxycycline is non-inferior to IV ceftriaxone for resolution of Lyme meningitis symptoms at 6 weeks. \n\nSecondary Objectives: 1) Oral doxycycline is non-inferior to IV ceftriaxone for resolution of cranial neuritis at 6 weeks, 2) Oral doxycycline is non-inferior to IV ceftriaxone for quality of life at 6 months, 3) Oral doxycycline is associated with fewer adverse events than IV ceftriaxone and 4) Oral doxycycline is more cost effective than IV ceftriaxone.	The primary outcome is clinical recovery of patients from Lyme meningitis at 6 weeks using a composite measure comprised of the 1) NeuroQoL Pediatric Pain instrument, 2) NeuroQoL Pediatric Fatigue instrument and 3) the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Measurements will occur electronically or telephonically at day 3 after enrollment and then weekly thereafter until 6 weeks after enrollment occurred. \n\nResolution of cranial neuritis (secondary outcome) will be assessed for children that have cranial neuritis at enrollment. Six weeks after enrollment, participants will be provided with detailed instructions about how to submit photographic documentation using the recommendations of the Sir Charles Bell Society (Santosa, et al.); a group of medical professionals that treat patients with facial palsy.The photographic documentation will include 10 static views of the child's face: at rest, with small closed-mouth smile, with large smile showing teeth, elevating eyebrows, closing eyes gently, closing eyes tightly, puckering lips, showing bottom teeth, snarling or wrinkling the nose, and nasal base view. If possible, participants will also be asked to submit a short video of the child's facial movements during normal activities. Photodocumentation and videos will be reviewed by two neurologists blinded to treatment arm and scored on the House-Brackmann Facial Paralysis Scale. These methods have been previously used in large trials and have been validated for distinguishing residual facial nerve paralysis (Scheller, et al.).\n\nQuality of life (QoL) will be measured using the PedsQL instrument administered 6 months after enrollment. Data will be collected by telephone, which is reliable for children in our proposed age range [36]. The PedsQL instrument has been validated and used for a variety of illnesses with neurologic manifestations [37]-[40]. The 23 item PedsQL includes measures of physical, emotional, social, and school function and takes less than 4 minutes to complete. A Spanish language version is available. The child self-report is recommended for children 8 -17 years old. For children who are unable to provide a self-report, we will obtain a parent proxy-report. Cronbach's alpha for the full 23-item scale approach 0.90 (excellent) for self- and proxy-report. There are no floor effects and minimal ceiling effects.\n\nSafety outcome data (adverse events) will include frequency counts of adverse events, as identified by participant-initiated phone calls during the 30 day period following enrollment. At enrollment, families will be provided with telephone numbers and written instructions they can use to contact research staff for questions, concerns or to report adverse events. Research staff will respond within 4 hours to any calls, and will involve the site PICC nurse for PICC-related queries. Families will be instructed that if they believe an adverse event is emergent to seek immediate medical care. For all telephone contacts a standardized case report form (CRF) will be used to record the communication. The CRFs will include detailed questions to ascertain any adverse events that may have occurred, and if they meet the definition of a pre-defined safety outcome. We will also query the medical record and talk with the participants 6 weeks after enrollment to identify any adverse events that were not previously reported. \n\nCost effectiveness analysis: TBD	2	INCLUSION:\n1. Age < 22 years\n2. Child has illness characterized by headache, neck pain, and/or cranial neuritis\n3. Lumbar puncture reveals cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (WBC > 7 per high power field in a non-traumatic LP)\n4. Child diagnosed with Lyme disease by one of the following criteria:\n     a. Positive two-tier Lyme serology (within 7 days of LP), or\n     b. Erythema migrans (EM) rash identified by treating clinician\n\nEXCLUSION:\n1. Allergy to doxycycline or ceftriaxone\n2. Treatment with antibiotics for more than 48 hours at the time of enrollment\n3. Pregnancy\n4. Underlying neurocognitive diseases that preclude accurate assessment of symptoms	We have identified 13 tertiary care hospitals in Lyme disease endemic areas of the U.S. who have agreed to participate in the trial. We have identified 12 additional hospitals who would participate in collecting longitudinal data with treatment decided by clinician choice.	Oral doxycycline (4 mg/kg up to 100 mg) twice per day versus IV Ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg up to 2 g) once per day	7 years (using Investigator Initiated Extended Clinical Trial mechanism (PAR-18-630))	6 months	No financial ties or conflict of interests	The longitudinal measurements of 4 arms will be simultaneously modeled in a single Generalized Estimating Equation for each dependent variable (excluding time-to-event outcomes, which are described below). Within-patient measures repeated over time will be modeled as having correlated error. The variance-covariance structure will be selected at the time of analysis, but would most likely be chosen from compound symmetry or 1st order autoregressive, with classical sandwich estimation applied to adjust for model misspecification. Similarly, the distribution and link function will be chosen at the time of analysis based on principle (binomial used to constrain measures with bounds, Poisson or Negative Binomial for counts), and where more than one may apply, selection will be based on review of model residual panels. Note: because some sites will be exclusively enrolling one arm, inclusion of a random intercept for site would be fully confounded for these sites (i.e. the site-specific intercept would leave no residual variance for comparing effect of treatment). All hypothesis tests will take place using orthogonal linear estimates within the comprehensive model for a given outcome. For the test of non-inferior efficacy of oral to IV abx, a linear contrast will be formed comparing the change from baseline between the efficacy arms against a non-zero null defined by the non-inferiority margin for that outcome at each follow-up time point, with alpha maintained at 0.05 using the Holm stepdown procedure. An identical test will be performed for effectiveness using the corresponding effectiveness arms. No additional alpha adjustment will be applied to accommodate separate testing of efficacy and effectiveness owing to the expectation they would be highly correlated tests, making adjustment overly conservative. As a secondary hypothesis. the size of the efficacy difference will be compared to the size of the effectiveness difference in change from baseline. Time-to-event outcomes will use comparable model structures, but using proportional hazards regression.	This trial is currently being developed with support from an NIAID sponsored R34 Trial Planning Grant. The R01 application would be submitted in March 2019 so earliest funding would occur in late 2019 or 2020. The R34 Trial Planning Grant allows us to prepare sites for participation so we anticipate a relatively short period between funding start date and active recruitment at participating sites. \n\nWe anticipate the average enrollment will be 2 participants per year, based on our preliminary data from Pedi Lyme Net and site audits. This would allow us to meet our goal of 350 enrollments within the 7 years allowed under the Investigator Initiated Extended Clinical Trial mechanism (PAR-18-630). Recruitment efforts are essential to meeting enrollment goals.
457	2019-02-05	20	\N	t	Precision Anesthesia: A Genomics Study of Post Cesarean Section Narcotic Requirements	Genetic Indicators of Narcotic Requirements	2	Post c-section patients show unpredictable variability in their narcotic requirements for pain control. In this prospective study, we will identify genetic variations associated with increased narcotic requirement for pain control in women who undergo c-section delivery for childbirth. Our hypothesis is that genetic differences are partially responsible for the variability associated with post c-section narcotic requirements for pain management. By identifying these gene variations, we will gain insight for improving pain management, minimize opioid usage when it is not needed, and develop alternative analgesic interventions when doses escalate. Among the concerns for higher doses is the potential for addiction.	This is an observational, prospective multi-center genetic association study to identify the genetic underpinning of narcotic requirements post c-section. One thousand pregnant patients, ages 18 to 40, undergoing c-section delivery will be enrolled. All patients will receive the same standardized regional anesthesia technique, and have their 72-hour post c-section narcotic requirements recorded. Using an extreme phenotype sampling model, patients with the 10% highest and 10% lowest narcotic requirements will be compared for gene variations associated with pain or pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pain medications. Other demographic data will be collected and correlated with phenotype.	The primary objective is to identify gene variations associated with increased narcotic requirements for pain control in women undergoing c-section delivery for childbirth. The secondary objective is to advance the concept of genome-powered healthcare and "Precision Anesthesia" by developing a genetic testing panel that enables anesthesiologists to deliver safer and more precise individualized anesthesia, and avoid medications that may lead to narcotic addiction. Aim 1 will identify c-section mothers with extreme narcotic requirements. Aim 2 will determine genetic differences between the extreme phenotypes (high and low narcotic requirements) identified in Aim 1. Aim 3 will create a multi-center Precision Anesthesia Consortium. Validation of genetic variants as causative for given phenotypes requires large sample sizes. A consortium is necessary to achieve the sample sizes required to answer phenotype-genotype relationship questions and test generalizability of findings. The consortium will develop a Precision Anesthesia biobank for future validation of findings in Aim 2, and for other anesthesia-related phenotypes.	The primary endpoint is identification and confirmation of extreme phenotypes on the spectrum of narcotic requirements for pain control post c-section delivery for childbirth. This will be determined by calculating the 72-hour post c-section morphine equivalents required for pain control for each enrolled patient. Those patients with the highest (10%) and lowest (10%) morphine equivalents will be tested for gene variants associated with pain or pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pain medications and compared. Identification of genetic differences between the extreme phenotypes is the secondary endpoint.	1	Any pregnant patient between the ages of 18 and 40 who is undergoing a c-section with the standardized regional anesthesia technique described in the protocol. Patients who require general anesthesia will not be included.	Presently, four sites have agreed to participate. These are the Departments of Anesthesiology at the Universities of Minnesota, Iowa, Florida and the Mayo Clinic. Expansion to other sites is planned, but none are outside the United States.	The study does not involve a drug or biologic intervention, nor a device.	We estimate that it will take 12 months to enroll all 1,000 patients from four institutions, and then another 12 months to perform the genetic analysis and interpretation, for a total of 24 months.	All data and samples from participants will be completed within 72 hours after their c-section delivery.	We have no financial ties or conflicts of interest related to this study.	Allele counts will be stratified by phenotype and Chi squared test statistics and p-values evaluated for significance. From 200 samples, with a power of 80%, an effect size of 3.2 (relative risk) can be detected. Clustering of associated genotypes will be done by principle component analysis. Given the limited sample size, this approach will identify potential candidate SNPs that will be validated in a larger sample size in the future through the multi-center consortium. Variables such as pre-existing conditions (eg. diabetes), previous use of pain medication and pain tolerance will be controlled for in the analyses. DNA samples will be preserved for future association studies of other candidate genes, Whole Genome Association Studies (GWAS) or targeted sequencing, in the event that no associations between the proposed genes and the phenotypes are found.	Each of the four medical centers engaged in this study performs approximately 1,000 c-sections per year. The goal is for each center to enroll one quarter (250) of their c-section patients. Since the study does not involve any changes in the normal and customary standard of care, and blood drawn for genotyping will be performed in conjunction with placement of intravenous access for the delivery of anesthesia, there is no real added risk to the patients. In collaboration with our obstetric co-investigators, consent for the study will be performed during routine pre-natal visits. While 1,000 patients will be enrolled and have their DNA preserved, only those patients with the extreme phenotype (200) will be genotyped for the pain-related variants. We believe these to be reasonable recruitment goals for a pilot study that will allow us to establish a system for expansion in the future.
467	2019-02-20	5	\N	t	Glycemic Profile of Pregnancy Consortium Biostatistics Research Center	GPPC BRC	6	NIDDK is creating a new Glycemic Profile of Pregnancy Consortium (GPPC). This new consortium will collectively design a multi-site observational study to investigate glycemic profiles in pregnant women without pre-existing diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology. CGM profiles will be investigated for association with development of gestational diabetes at ~28 weeks gestation and outcomes in mothers and newborns at delivery. A pair of RFAs are published and will be awarded to 5-7 Clinical Centers (CCs) and 1 Biostatistics Research Center (BRC). This proposal pertains to our application to the BRC RFA (RFA-DK-18-019).	GPPC CCs (anticipated 5-7) will recruit non-diabetic pregnant participants. Women will be prospectively enrolled during the first trimester. Observational study components will be timed with routine prenatal care visits. Participants will wear CGM monitors for ~10 day time periods at multiple time points during pregnancy, e.g. 12, 20, 28 and 33 weeks' gestation. Biospecimens including blood and urine samples are also likely to be collected at study visits, although the precise sample types and counts remain to be determined pending the selected CCs and agreed upon protocol. Women will be followed through delivery of their newborn.	Primary and secondary objectives for the study will be finalized upon selection of CCs and the BRC, but will pertain to analyses that characterize glycemic profiles and identify associations with GDM and birth outcomes. \n\nBelow is an example of specific aims from a CC application that will be submitted: \n\n1. To use CGM to examine the natural history of glycemia during pregnancy, among a cohort of women enriched for those at greater risk of GDM, by monitoring glucose levels over a 10-day time period at 4 time points across pregnancy. \n2. To use standard and advanced analytic approaches, including functional data analysis (FDA), to analyze CGM data and thereby identify signatures of maternal glycemia early in gestation (i.e., prior to 21 weeks) that are associated with the subsequent development of GDM.  \n3. To use standard and advanced analytic approaches to analyze CGM data and identify maternal glycemic signatures across pregnancy associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.\n\nBelow are the specific aims that we intend to submit with our BRC application:\n1. Provide state-of-the-art data and general coordinating functionality for the Glycemic Profile of Pregnancy Consortium's study by: facilitating protocol development and implementation procedures, designing and maintaining case report forms (CRFs) and a centralized database, linking multiple data types including CRF-based data and sensor-based CGM data, constructing and implementing timely quality assurance pipelines for all accumulating data, facilitating laboratory sample transfer, maintaining study governance structures and procedures, and facilitating communication among Clinical Centers.\n2. Harness collaborative and methodologic statistical expertise to develop novel and clinically interpretable models for CGM data to characterize glycemic profiles during pregnancy and predict gestational diabetes and adverse pregnancy outcomes. \n3. Translate population-based research findings for potential screening strategies and development of clinical trials to address gestational hyperglycemia in collaboration with all stakeholders.	As stated above, primary and secondary outcomes will be finalized upon selection of GPPC CCs.\n\nPrimary outcomes are expected to include: \n1. Gestational diabetes diagnosed at ~28 weeks gestation according to routine clinical Carpenter-Coustan criteria.\n2. Large-for-gestational age (LGA) birth, i.e. birthweight >90th percentile for gestational age\n\nSecondary outcomes may include: \n1. Antepartum: new-onset medical conditions (e.g., venous thromboembolism) and obstetric complications (e.g., presence and timing of onset for HDP, preterm rupture of the membranes, preterm labor, intrauterine demise). Also, fetal sonographic information related to growth (e.g., head and abdominal circumference, femur length, estimated weight, ponderal index) obtained during clinical care will be collected.  Women who develop GDM will have information gathered regarding therapeutic interventions (e.g., medical nutritional therapy, use of pharmacologic agents).\n2. Intrapartum: Gestational age at delivery, type of labor onset (spontaneous, induced, or none), indication for delivery, route of delivery (spontaneous or operative vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery), indication for operative delivery, chorioamnionitis, shoulder dystocia.\n3. Postpartum: Hemorrhage, febrile morbidity (e.g., endometritis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis), blood transfusion (and number of units), intensive care unit admission (and primary indication), mechanical ventilation, mortality.\n4. Neonatal: Apgars at 1 and 5 minutes (and at 10 minutes if measured), intermediate or intensive care unit admission, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, need for ventilatory support (intubation or continuous positive airway pressure) after more than 30 minutes of life, nectrotizing enterocolitis, suspected or confirmed sepsis, intracranial or subgaleal hemorrhage, hypoglycemia (with glucose at diagnosis and details of treatment), treatment for hyperbilirubinemia, treatment for hypocalcemia, fracture, nerve palsy, hypotension requiring pressor support, seizures, hypoxic ischemic asphyxia (and any head and/or body cooling), mortality.	1	All pregnant women with singleton pregnancies less than 14 weeks of gestation will be eligible for enrollment in this study, except where specific exclusion criteria are present.  Exclusion criteria are as follows:  (i) Age < 16 years at the time of the enrollment; (ii) Plan to deliver at another hospital;  (iii) No ultrasound confirmation of gestational age or viability prior to enrollment;  (iv) Multiple pregnancy; (v) Conception with donor egg or sperm; (vi) Previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus requiring treatment with medication outside of pregnancy;  (vii) HgbA1c > 6.4% prior to enrollment; (viii) Use of any medication at enrollment known to affect glycemia (e.g., corticosteroids, metformin); (ix) Participation in another study which would interfere with this study (e.g., a randomized masked study of a medication that affects glycemia); (x) Participation in the study during a previous pregnancy.	Planned participating sites will be GPPC CCs awarded by NIDDK. Only domestic sites will be included. A total of 5-7 sites are anticipated. Sites will be awarded according to a proven track record to recruit and retain pregnant research study participants.	The GPPC study will include use of wearable continuous glucose monitor (CGM) technology. The study will be designed to use CGM for observational data collection only. CGM will used for all participants. CGM will not be tested as an intervention to improve outcomes.\n\nCGMs are minimally invasive monitors that are used to measure blood glucose. A very small sensor is inserted just below the skin using an applicator, and is held in place by an adhesive patch. CGM technology measures blood glucose levels every 5 minutes and sends real-time glucose reads to a wireless receiver.	Estimated time is 48 months from when the study opens to enrollment until completion of data analyses. 60 months are study funding are anticipated, but the first 12 will be dedicated to study planning and IRB approval processes.	Patients will complete all participant visits within 7-9 months, depending on the final study design.	There are no conflicts of interest for myself or the study team pertaining to this study.	The first step of data analysis will be CGM profile characterization. Straightforward summaries do exist, for example to mean glucose over a time frame or the proportion of time above or below desirable glucose range limits. We will complement these summaries by exploring functional data analysis methods using B-spline fitting and latent class trajectory analyses. Ultimately, we intend to classify women according to glucose profile similarity over time. \n\nAssociations of CGM data with GDM and pregnancy outcomes will proceed using straightforward numerical summaries, FDA and latent classes based on trajectory analyses as the exposures of interest. Longitudinal models for repeated measures will be used to investigate associations of repeated straightforward summaries at multiple time points with GDM and birth outcomes, allowing for correlation of observations within individuals using random effects. Model covariates will include baseline factors such as study site, mother's age, race/ethnicity, neonatal sex where appropriate (in order to account for differences by sex), as well as other time-varying measures such as maternal BMI at each time of CGM use. Models will be developed for both binary and continuous outcomes using generalized linear mixed modeling techniques. We will also investigate predictive accuracy of early pregnancy CGM profiles for GDM at 28 weeks, based on estimates for sensitivity and specificity. Only CGM data from the first two study visits will be used to assess associations with GDM.	\N

74	2016-12-06	70	\N	\N	Investigation of Antimycobacterial Therapy on Progressive, Pulmonary Sarcoidosis	Pulmonary Sarcoidosis Study	\N	Primary Objective:  To assess the efficacy and safety of oral CLEAR therapy in patients with confirmed progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis.                                Hypothesis: The CLEAR regimen will improve the absolute FVC percent predicted in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis participants by augmenting T cell responses through the normalization of p56Lck expression and IL-2 production.	This is a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A maximum of 128 patients will be randomized, 64 in each arm. Participants will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 (stratifying on use of prednisone and by site) to receive either CLEAR therapy or identical-appearing placebo, in addition to the participant's standard care therapy. Treatment will continue for a maximum of 112 days.    The primary endpoint will be change in absolute FVC. Secondary endpoints will include investigation of steroid-sparing effects of CLEAR regimen, assessments of 6MWD, SGRQ, chest tomography (CT) radiographic changes and effects on T cell biologic function through the induction of IL-2 pathway in sarcoidosis BAL and PBMC. In addition, we will use reporter mycophages to characterize viable mycobacteria within sarcoidosis BAL. The safety profile will be assessed through detection of adverse events and abnormal lab values. The 1o and 2o endpoints will be obtained over a six month interval, laying the foundation for a definitive Phase 3 investigation.	The primary aim of this study is to determine the effect of CLEAR therapy versus placebo on the change in percent predicted absolute forced vital capacity (FVC) in participants with pulmonary sarcoidosis, comparing baseline with performance after completion of 16 weeks of therapy.

The funding period for the planning grant is 7/1/2016-6/30/2017. The primary aims for the clinical trial are:    Primary Aim. Compare the effectiveness of 3 biologically distinct treatments (certolizumab, abatacept, and tocilizumab administered in combination with methotrexate; MTX) to MTX monotherapy, in achieving clinical inactive disease (CID) at 12 months in children with poly-JIA in the context of a randomized controlled trial.    Hypothesis: Biologic treatment started as initial therapy in poly-JIA is more effective thanMTX monotherapy in achieving CID at 12 months.    Secondary Aim. Compare the effectiveness of 3 biologically distinct treatments (certolizumab, abatacept, and tocilizumab administered in combination with MTX) to MTX monotherapy, in achieving CID at 6 months in children with poly-JIA in the context of a randomized controlled trial.    Hypothesis: Biologic treatment started as initial therapy in poly-JIA is more effective than MTX monotherapy in achieving CID at 6 months.    Exploratory Aims. 1. Compare proportions of patients achieving CID between the biologic therapies at 6 and 12 months. 2. Identify clinical and biologic predictors of achieving CID at 12 months and non-response by analyzing individual patient trajectories.	Proposed study design:  COMPARE-JIA will be a multicenter, randomized study with pragmatic features comparing the effectiveness of biologic medications with different mechanisms of action administered in combination with MTX, to MTX monotherapy, as first-line therapy for poly-JIA. It will be the first JIA clinical trial to include multiple biologic agents. COMPARE-JIA will also enable exploratory subgroup analyses, defined a priori, to provide preliminary data regarding treatment response in specific subgroups of patients (e.g. rheumatoid factor positive versus negative). This trial also seeks to identify predictors, both clinical and biologic, or combinations of predictors, of nonresponse and response to therapy. The identification of predictors of response and non-response will provide valuable information to physicians and patients making initial biologic treatment choices, making it possible to determine early in the treatment course whether the patient is likely to respond or would benefit from a medication change. Identifying predictors of response and non-response is an important step towards tailoring treatment to individual patient characteristics, using precision medicine approaches to guide JIA treatment.    The trial design has innovative pragmatic features, including: 1) broad inclusion criteria enhancing generalizability, since patients will have a wider range of disease activity and clinical manifestations than generally allowed in traditional clinical trials; and 2) clinical and laboratory assessments mirroring routine clinical care to facilitate patient enrollment and translation of the study results into real-world practice.    During the course of this 12-month planning phase, we are optimizing and finalizing all components necessary to conduct COMPARE-JIA, a multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of biologic medications with different mechanisms of action plus MTX to MTX alone as first-line therapy for poly-JIA. In this trial, children with poly-JIA will be randomized to one of 4 biologically distinct treatments (MTX, MTX + certolizumab, MTX + tocilizumab, MTX + abatacept). The primary outcome will be the ACR provisional criteria for CID at 12 months. Exams by blinded joint assessors will be performed at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12- months. Importantly, the study is also powered to compare the proportion of children with CID at 6 months following enrollment. Blood samples will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months for later analyses to identify biologic predictors of response and non-response to therapy.     This trial will be conducted with the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) research network, utilizing the existing patient Registry infrastructure for data collection.    Please see attached proposal for additional details regarding study outcomes, and visit schedule and assessments.	Planning for a trial that has the following aims:    Primary Aim.

Pairwise comparison of MTX with the 3 biologics for the outcome of clinical inactive disease at 12 month.    Clinical inactive disease at 12 months will be defined using the American College of Rheumatology provisional criteria for clinical inactive disease (Wallace CA et al, Arthritis Care Res. 2011;63[7]:929-36):    No joints with active arthritis    Normal ESR/CRP, if tested    No uveitis (as defined by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature working group)    No fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly or diffuse lymphadenopathy attributable to JIA    Physician assessment of disease activity score of best possible on the scale used    Morning stiffness <= 15 minutes	2	Inclusion Criteria:    �  JIA with ? 5 active joints at enrollment visit    �  Age 4-18 years (regardless of age at diagnosis)    �  Diagnosis within the prior 12 months    �  Enrollment in CARRA Registry (can be at study enrollment)      Allowed prior treatment:    �  Prior treatment with oral glucocorticoids permitted if < 4 weeks duration and discontinued ? 1 week prior to enrollment    �  Prior intraarticular glucocorticoid injection allowed if <=2 joints and > 2 months prior to enrollment    �  Current methotrexate use if duration at the time of enrollment is <=2 weeks        Exclusion Criteria:      Systemic JIA as defined by 2004 ILAR criteria6    �  Sacroiliitis (clinical or radiographic)    �  Psoriasis    �  Dactylitis    �  History of uveitis or currently active uveitis    �  Prior treatment with systemic conventional or biologic DMARD(s) except for as noted in inclusion criteria    �  History of malignancy or known/suspected malignancy    �  Active infection requiring IV antibiotics within 1 month prior to enrollment or PO antibiotics within 2 weeks of enrollment    �  Current or planned pregnancy during the subsequent 12 months	30-40	Eligible participants will be randomized at the patient level to one of four treatment arms below in a 1:1:1:1 scheme:    1.

Randomization will be stratified based on whether or not patients received prednisone.	Enrollment plan will be finalized during the planning phase.	12 months	Dr. Schanberg has served on a DSMB for certolizumab and currently serves as a PI for the CARRA Registry.	(To be refined further in the planning stage):  The primary comparison (biologic therapies compared to MTX monotherapy for proportion of patients achieving CID at 12 months) will be made using Dunnett's test and will compare each biologic arm versus MTX in a pairwise fashion, using a critical chi-squared of 5.5178 or, equivalently, an alpha-level of 0.01882.  Study-side alpha-level will be 0.05. Because of relatively small sample sizes in each arm, comparisons will use Fisher's mid-p test will power close to that of standard chi-square test, but persevering the nominal alpha level. Confidence intervals will be calculated using unconditional exact methods.      Based on current sample size calculations (below) we estimate a required sample size of 50 patients per arm with an additional 15% recruited to account for potential drop-outs. The final estimated sample size is 230. Please see attached Research Plan for details of the sample size calculation.	Enrollment plan will be finalized during the planning phase.

Enrolled EM residency programs in the Airway Mastery Collaborative working collaboratively these past few years, will adopt and promote mastery performance levels of achievement refined after a baseline control year. Our AMC team includes 6 full professors (including Anesthesiology, EM and Simulation experts), 3 associate professors, and the potential to positively influence over 1600 EM trainees. We hypothesize that following these simulation and clinical performance data, that human complications will be reduced and safe, first pass success of endotracheal intubation (ETI) will be increased, compared to control conditions.  Results of these studies will be disseminated to other programs for their implementation once completed.	Purpose: The study design is an interventional human trial in which the subjects are EM trainees (resident physicians).  \nStudy Phase: III\nIntervention assignment method: non-randomized\nNumber of arms: 4	1.\tIn year one, study each resident post-graduate year to calculate baseline normative data for each level, in order to calibrate the performance assessment for using the Airway Management Checklist.  Measure beginning and mastery standard performance thresholds for simulated emergency airway management (EAM) at hub sites. \n2.\tIn study year one, document and identify clinical complication rates and intubation results of all enrolled EM residents.  Continue data collection through year four of the study to identify trends in clinical performance.\n3.\tIn study year 2, perform a baseline simulation assessment for new interns.  Then, communicate simulation and clinical performance metrics, stimulating programs to address needs for individual remediation. \n4.\tPlanned scholarly products from aims 1-4 will be disseminated to facilitate broad implementation of useful findings in other EM training programs during study year 5.	The primary outcomes of this aim are proficiency of EM trainees in airway management, defined as first pass success, and related complications, defined by poor control of hypoxia.	1	Emergency medicine resident physician	10 academic institutions.

386	2018-08-10	55	\N	t	Hyperphenylalaninemia Rare Disorders Consortium	Hyperphe consortium	6	The Hyperphenylalaninemia Consortium will be a collaboration of six academic centers dedicated to clinical research on rare inherited disorders associated with hyperphenylalaninemia including phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (colloquially known as phenylketonuria (PKU), disorders of biopterin synthesis and recycling, and DNAJC12 deficiency. The primary project will be a longitudinal natural history study of all disorders with recruitment at all six sites.	A longitudinal natural history study of all disorders will be designed. As we are in the process of developing the grant application, the precise details of the study protocol have not yet been determined. We will recruit subjects of all ages and both genders with any of the target disorders for inclusion in the longitudinal trial. Therefore, we will initially recruit a cross-sectional cohort, but these will be studied prospectively for at least five years, the length of the initial award period, and hopefully for longer.	Our primary objective is to evaluate health, cognitive, behavioral, quality of life, and patient reported outcomes longitudinally in subjects with inherited disorders associated with hyperphenylalaninemia. Our secondary objective is to explore correlations between those outcomes with current treatments and biomarkers. The obvious biomarker to evaluate is the correlation between blood phenylalanine, both acutely but also chronic exposure, to outcome measures. For disorders of biopterin synthesis and recycling and for DNAJC12 deficiency, CSF monoamine neurotransmitter content will also be a relevant measure.	At each clinic visit, we will collect standard medical history information, information on dietary intake, physical examination, and laboratory data obtained as part of standard of care. Biochemical measures will include periodic measurement of plasma amino acids including phenylalanine and the other aromatic amino acids and for biopterin defects and DNAJC12 deficiency measurement of biopterin concentration and monoamine neurotransmitters in CSF. Additionally, we will perform periodic neurocognitive and behavioral assessments using specific instruments from the NIH Toolbox, administer a PKU-specific Quality of Life tool, and a patient reported outcomes questionnaire (PROMIS). We are also planning, for adolescents and adults, DEXA scanning to measure body composition and bone density. All of this data will be uploaded into a remote database to be developed with the NIH-funded Data Management Coordinating Center (DMCC).	3	Inclusion criteria: \n1.\tPersistent hyperphenylalaninemia \n2.\tConfirmation of diagnosis with one of the target disorders either biochemically or molecularly\n\nExclusion criteria:\n1.

We will need to collaborate with major molecular diagnostic laboratories to advertise our study to providers and through them to families of individuals diagnosed with DNAJC12 deficiency.
254	\N	99	\N	\N	A Phase 1 Study of SP-2577 (LSD1 inhibitor) in Combination with Chemotherapy in Children with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)	Phase I Study of LSD1 inhibitor in Pediatric ALL/AML	1	There is an urgent need for new therapies to improve outcomes for children and adults with recurrent acute leukemias and to mitigate toxicities from treatment with conventional agents. We have discovered and mechanistically characterized a critical pro-survival axis in myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells comprised of Growth Factor Independence (GFI)1 and its obligate epigenetic effector, Lysine Specific Demethylase (LSD)1. Colleagues at the University of Utah and Salarius Pharmaceuticals have developed a small molecule inhibitor of LSD1, SP-2577 and we propose to evaluate SP-2577 in a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias.  We hypothesize SP-2577 will be well tolerated in combination with salvage chemotherapy and will demonstrate activity in these diseases.	This phase I study will investigate three dose levels of SP-2577 in combination with conventional chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory ALL and AML.  After completion of the dose escalation, an expansion phase will be conducted separately in ALL and AML to further assess the safety, feasibility and biological activity of this therapy. Pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies to evaluate target inhibition will be performed. Remission rates and measurements of minimal residual disease will be determined at the end of the first treatment cycle and responding patients can receive 2 cycles of therapy.	Primary Objectives:\n1. To determine the safety and feasibility of administering SP-2577 as part of re-induction therapy for relapsed or refractory ALL and AML.\n2. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SP-2577 in relapsed/refractory ALL and AML.\n3. To characterize the toxicities of SP-2577 single agent and combination therapy.\nSecondary Objectives:\n1. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of SP-2577 in pediatric patients with relapsed/ refractory leukemia.\n2. To preliminarily determine anti-leukemic activity of SP-2577 alone and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or 5-azacytidine.\n3. To evaluate the biological activity of SP-2577 by assessing biomarkers of LSD1 inhibition.	The primary endpoint is the occurrence of a DLT. The secondary endpoints include response and target inhibition.	2	Inclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients must be > 6 and < 31 years of age at the time of enrollment.\n2. Patients must have a diagnosis of second or greater relapse of B-precursor (B-ALL), T-precursor ALL (T-ALL) or AML with >25% blasts in the bone marrow (M3), with or without extramedullary disease or an M2 marrow (>5 to <25% blasts) with extramedullary disease.\n3. Patients with refractory leukemia who have failed to achieve an M1 marrow after receiving salvage therapy at the time of second or greater relapse are eligible.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients with Down syndrome are excluded.\n2. Patients with B-cell ALL (L3 morphology or evidence of myc translocation by molecular or cytogenetic technique) are not eligible.\n3. Patients with active and uncontrolled infection at the time of study entry are not eligible.\n4. Patients currently receiving other investigational agents are not eligible.\n5. Patients with any significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric disorder or social issue that would compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with consent, study participation, follow-up or the interpretation of the study results are not eligible.	Huntsman Cancer Institute, Intermountain Healthcare and NYU Langone Medical Center	This phase 1 study will determine the tolerability and biological activity of SP-2577 in patients 12-30 years old with second or greater relapse of ALL or AML, or refractory disease. Currently, the only available formulation of SP-2577 is 75 mg capsules, limiting the lower age inclusion range. During the first cycle, ALL patients will receive SP-2577 monotherapy at a dose of 75 mg PO TID on days 1-7. Cyclophosphamide and etoposide will be added on days 8-12 and SP-2577 will be continued on days 13-28. AML patients will be treated similarly, but instead will receive 5-azacytidine on days 8-12. If this dose of SP-2577 is found to be intolerable, a subsequent cohort will be enrolled at the de-escalated dose of 75 mg PO BID. If the starting dose of SP-2577 is tolerable, two additional dose levels will be investigated:  150 mg PO TID and 225 mg PO TID. \n\nWe envision refinement of the dose escalation schema based on the results of a phase 1 trial in Ewing sarcoma in children that is anticipated to open in the second quarter of 2018. The dose escalation phase of the trial will include both ALL and AML patients.  Following the dose confirmation phase, expanded cohorts of 6 ALL and 6 AML patients will be enrolled to further assess the safety, feasibility and biological activity of this therapy. Pharmacokinetic and correlative biology studies to evaluate target inhibition will also be performed. The activity of this combination will be preliminarily evaluated by assessing marrow disease status and peripheral blast clearance on day 8 and rates of remission and measurements of minimal residual disease (MRD) on day 29 of the combination regimen.	36 months	2 months	SP-2577 was developed at the University of Utah.	This will be a phase I trial conducted through the HICCP network, a partnership between the Huntsman Cancer Institute and Intermountain Healthcare, and NYU Langone Medical Center.  A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used and the DLT observation period will be the first cycle of therapy. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4.0. \n\nThe first 3 patients enrolled will be evaluated to determine the number of patients demonstrating a WBC count increase above 100,000/µL, or symptoms attributable to rapid disease progression during SP-2577 monotherapy from days 1 through 7. Conventional salvage treatment will be initiated if disease progresses rapidly. If 2 or more patients in either disease cohort demonstrate rapid WBC rise, enrollment will be temporarily suspended and consideration given to amending the study to exclude the single-agent SP-2577 pre-phase for future enrollments.\n\nThe recommended Phase 2 dose for SP-2577 + chemotherapy is the dose at which no more than one of 6 evaluable patients has had a DLT and target inhibition is achieved during the study prephase. A total of up to 6 additional patients with ALL and AML will be treated at the recommended phase 2 dose for SP-2577 + chemotherapy to assess the toxicity and tolerability at that dose.\n\nDLT will be defined as any of the following events that are at least (possibly, probably or definitely) attributable to SP-2577. Non-hematological DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or greater non-hematological toxicity attributable to the investigational drug with the specific exclusion of: Grade 3 nausea and vomiting, Grade 3 or 4 fever or infection, Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities that are transient (<24 hours) and not associated with clinical sequelae  and alopecia.  Hematological DLT will be defined as the absence of peripheral blood count recovery (ANC > 500/μL and platelet count > 20,000/μL) within 6 weeks of starting systemic chemotherapy (protocol Day 8) in those patients who achieve remission as documented by marrow aplasia, not marrow infiltration.\n\nA patient enrolled on the trial who receives any prescribed therapy is considered evaluable for toxicity. A patient is evaluable for DLT if they terminate protocol therapy due to toxicity, or if they receive at least 85% of protocol prescribed therapy during cycle 1 without experiencing DLT. A patient enrolled on the trial who receives any prescribed therapy is considered evaluable for response.	We anticipate enrollment of 3-4 patients annually through the HICCP network and 1-2 patients annually at NYU Langone Medical Center.  If safety and tolerability are established in an initial cohort of patients, we will expand enrollment to younger and older patients. Upon favorable early assessment of SP-2577 locally, we also envision an opportunity for study expansion to other centers, whereby accruals are expected to rise to 1-2 pediatric patients per month. We anticipate accrual of a maximum of 30 patients over 36 months. This estimate is based on the number of potentially eligible patients we see in each of the practices.  Given the relative rarity of the patient population, recruitment efforts are important for meeting accrual goals.

37	2016-12-06	40	\N	\N	PDE5 Inhibition for the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events	PDE5 Study	4	The primary objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that chronic inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) will reduce cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal events in high-risk individuals.      Prior human studies of PDE5 inhibition have consistently demonstrated improvements in vascular and metabolic function. Increasing cGMP activity through PDE5 inhibition results in improvement in endothelial and glomerular function, inhibition of platelet aggregation, increased insulin sensitivity, and resistance to weight gain through enhanced energy expenditure. Mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of cGMP signaling include increased vascularity and vasodilation, reduced circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), mitochondrial biogenesis, and browning of white adipose tissue.    Human studies of PDE5 inhibition to date have been relatively small and focused on physiologic endpoints. Therefore, larger trials are needed to determine whether the beneficial physiologic effects of PDE5 inhibition translate into improved clinical outcomes.	We propose a randomized, placebo-controlled study to examine the effect of PDE5 inhibition on clinical outcomes in subjects at high risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal events. Subjects will be randomized in blinded fashion to tadalafil 20 mg/day or placebo. The treatment period will last at least 2 years. Procedures to minimize bias will include blinding of investigators and subjects, an independent outcome adjudication committee, and an independent data safety monitoring board.

Based on experience with other medications, we expect generic tadalafil to be 80% less expensive than branded tadalafil, which will make it cost-effective for the proposed trial. We have received an IND exemption from the FDA to use tadalafil for our prior studies; we are preparing an exemption application for this study and do not anticipate any obstacles to proceeding.    Tadalafil 20mg tablets will be supplied by the Vanderbilt Investigational Drug Service (IDS) or local, which will supply study drug and placebo to each site. The IDS will compound placebo tablets that are indistinguishable from tadalafil in appearance, smell, and taste. After a subject completes the screening and consent process a unique study ID will be assigned to him/her and the pharmacist will log into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) program to find the randomization group for this subject. Permuted block randomization stratified by gender and race (white and African-American) will be used to ensure approximate balance of treatment groups within each stratum over time. Separate randomization schemes are generated for each gender and race prior to study initiation by a biostatistician and schemes will be uploaded to a REDCap database. This randomization will be performed in small blocks, which vary in size. Investigators will be unaware of the size or order of the blocks.	Not provided	Not provided	\N	The assumed event rates shown below were adopted from the HOPE trial (NEJM, 2000), which provides a good estimation of the risk of our target population.  Medical therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and treatment of diabetes have evolved since the HOPE trial was conducted, which may require reconsideration of the assumed event rates.      We would be eager to work with the TIC to arrive at other event rate assumptions based on contemporary medical therapy for the target population. We would also be interested in working with the TIC on innovative trial designs to optimize statistical power and feasibility.    Sample Size and Power Calculation  Using the primary endpoint event rates (14.0% in the ramipril group and 17.8% in the placebo group after 5 years of follow-up) reported in the HOPE study, we calculated the hazard rate as 0.030 and 0.039 (HR of 0.769) in the ramipril and the placebo groups, respectively.  The common exponential drop-out rate was estimated as 0.074. When the sample size in each group is 2827, with a total number of events required of 522, an exponential maximum likelihood test of equality of survival curves with a 0.05 two-sided significance level will have 85% power to detect the difference between the hazard rates of 0.030 and 0.039, (a hazard ratio of 0.769); this assumes an accrual period of 2.5 years and a maximum follow-up time of 4.5 years. We plan to enroll a total of 5800, with 2900 subjects in each group.    Data Analysis Plan  For the primary endpoint and other secondary time-to-event endpoints, we will calculate the rate as the ratio of the total number of incident cases and the total number of person-years of follow-up for each treatment group. The standard error of the rate estimate will be obtained using the standard maximum likelihood method. Then the between-group incident rate ratio can be estimated along with the 95% confidence interval (CI) using the delta method. If the CI excludes one, we will conclude the incident rates are significantly different. For these time-to-event endpoints, Kaplan Meier survival or event curves will be constructed for each treatment group and the between-group comparison will be made using the log-rank test. If necessary, the COX proportional hazards model will be used to adjust for imbalanced covariates or key risk factors for the event when estimating the hazard ratio between the PDE5 inhibitor and placebo groups. We will test all hypotheses at the level of ?=0.05.     For all endpoints, the primary analysis will be intention-to-treat: all subjects randomized with a post-treatment endpoint assessment will be included. Any subject who is identified as a major protocol violator will not be included. Major protocol violators will be defined based on criteria that will be finalized by the study team and approved by the DSMB prior to unblinding. The list would include subjects randomized to PDE5 inhibition with undetectable drug concentrations on multiple study days, for example.	We anticipate that subjects will be enrolled primarily from Internal Medicine, Cardiology, and Endocrinology outpatient clinics.  Accordingly, we will select high-volume academic and community sites with broad research infrastructure and a track record of successful trial enrollment.  We welcome assistance from the TIC to identify such sites.    We will also engage in alternative recruitment strategies based on input from the Recruitment Innovation Center. Alternative strategies may include identification of subjects using methods to parse electronic medical records, social media, and community engagement meetings, among other approaches.    We expect an enrollment period of at least 2.5 years, though this would depend on enrollment rate and the observed event rate, depending on the study design. Follow-up will occur at months 1 and 6 and then yearly thereafter until study completion.  Subjects will be asked about side effects, adverse events, and medication compliance during study visits. To further improve compliance, we may consider automated emails and/or text messages to confirm adherence to study drug.
52	2016-12-07	55	\N	\N	Efficacy of a Gluten-free diet in difficult-to-manage nephrotic syndrome: Utility of plasma zonulin level as a predictive biomarker	Nephrotic Syndrome Study	\N	Objective/Hypothesis: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a rare condition that presents with proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema and normal kidney function. Most children (>90%) respond to oral corticosteroids and are designated as having steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS). They are presumed to have minimal change disease (MCD) and typically do not undergo a confirmatory kidney biopsy (1). However, approximately 30-50% of patients have difficult-to-manage disease characterized by steroid-dependence or frequent relapses. Patients with difficult-to-manage NS are often treated with immunosuppressive medications to alleviate debilitating side effects due to prolonged steroid therapy or sequelae of uncontrolled NS such as infection (2). However, these second-line agents also have significant side effects and/or are nephrotoxic. There is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic approaches to frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) and steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS) that are safe and well-tolerated and that can achieve extended remission of proteinuria.    Over the last 40 years, case reports and patient series have described the impact of food sensitivity and alterations in the diet to control the NS in pediatric and adult patients (3,4,5,6,7). Lagrue and colleagues (5) detailed their experience with 42 subjects with difficult-to-manage NS. Use of an oligoantigenic diet, which appears to have excluded gliadin, in 13 patients resulted in >50% reduction (median decrease 90%) in proteinuria in the majority and complete remission in 5 cases. The response was rapid, within a week in most cases, and proteinuria recurred in most responsive patients when the restricted diet was stopped. In a subset of patients with NS, long-term steroid-free remissions were achieved by more specific dietary elimination, including elimination of gluten (5). These observations suggest that gluten sensitivity (GS) may contribute to disease in select cases of childhood NS.    Celiac disease (CD), the classic gastrointestinal manifestation of GS, occurs in 1% of the population (8). Renal disease, including mesangial IgA deposition without clinically overt IgA nephropathy, has been described in patients with CD (9). In patients with IgA nephropathy, gluten induces alterations in intestinal immunity and barrier function (10). Withdrawal of gluten from the diet of some individuals with glomerular disease such as IgA nephropathy with NS has been reported to be associated with resolution of both CD and renal manifestations (11).    Primary childhood NS, which is predominantly due to either MCD or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) represents a podocytopathy (12). CD is characterized by loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier function (13). Circulating levels of zonulin, a protein that is implicated in the pathogenesis of CD, are elevated in CD and reduced upon instituting a gluten-free diet (14,15). Mechanistically, zonulin activates protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family and induces signaling events that lead to changes in the actin cytoskeleton and cell-cell junctions (16). PAR2 is expressed on podocytes and the gluten-induced elevation in serum zonulin levels may influence the interaction between PAR2 and PAR3, which has been implicated in cell signaling and podocyte structure and function (17). Implementation of a GFD diet may stabilize the podocyte actin cytoskeleton and have a favorable impact on the clinical course of children with difficult-to-manage NS through its effects on the zonulin-PAR2 axis. .    A group of pediatric nephrologists have compiled their experience with difficult-to-manage NS in a non-random cohort of patients whose clinical behavior was ameliorated after starting a GFD. 8 children, 7M/1F, age 3-15 years, with difficult-to-manage nephrotic syndrome were placed on a GFD for 3.4�4.3 years (range:1-14). In each case, there was a clinical improvement with a marked reduction in the relapse rate that enabled reduction or discontinuation in steroid dosage. This is the largest series documenting the efficacy of this non-pharmacological approach to NS in children or adults (18). This suggests that in a subset of children with difficult-to-manage NS, a relatively simple and safe intervention, elimination of gluten from the diet, may reduce the need for potentially toxic immunosuppressive therapies. However, there is a need to develop a non-invasive biomarker that can be used to identify patients who might benefit from this dietary treatment.    We will test the hypothesis that an elevated plasma zonulin levels is a valid biomarker to identify children with difficult-to-manage NS who have a higher likelihood of responding to a GFD. The objective is to conduct    an open-label pilot study and to assess the efficacy and safety of use of a GFD in treatment children with difficult-to-manage NS targeted at the subset of patients high plasma zonulin levels.	Study Design: The study will be a multi-center, prospective, open-label study of the efficacy of a GFD in children with difficult-to-manage NS to assess the impact of this dietary intervention on disease activity. It will represent a shared project between the CTSI units at the seven participating institutions. The site investigators contributed to the recent case series of children with difficult-to-manage NS who improved in response to a GFD (18).    Patients will be identified at each site using the electronic health record or divisional databases. After providing consent, the NS disease activity - number of relapses in prior 12 months FRNS or SDNS status, current medications, and side effects of steroids and other immunosuppressive drugs - will be recorded.    The plasma zonulin levels will be analyzed in accord with previously published methods. They will be determined using a commercially available ELISA kit (Immundiagnostik AG, Stubenwald-Allee 8a, D-64625 Bensheim, Germany) in the NYU Core Laboratory under the direction of Debra Morrison PhD. Results will be considered abnormal if the plasma zonulin level is above 34 ng/ml.    Patients with an elevated circulating zonulin-level will have baseline laboratory testing done to assess kidney function and proteinuria. A complete physical examination will be done including measurement of height, weight, BMI, BP and In addition the following blood tests will be performed to exclude CD -- IgA level, tissue transglutaminase IgA, anti-gliadin IgA, and anti-gliadin IgG.    After consultation with a nutritionist, the families will be instructed to implement a strict GFD. Patients will be evaluated by a renal nutritionist and given instructions on how to implement a GFD. They will be seen after 2 weeks to verify adherence to the modified diet and willingness to remain on the diet for at least 6 months.    The patients with difficult-to-treat NS and high plasma zonulin levels will then be treated with the GFD for 6 months. Adherence to the diet will be reassessed by the nutritionist at 3 months during the Treatment Period. The disease activity during the 6-month Treatment Period will be compared to the 12-month period prior to enrollment.    There will be no additional cost to participants. The study team will be responsible for covering the costs of analysis of the plasma zonulin levels and other laboratory testing will be guided to current clinical practice guidelines.         The risks are primarily those of a GFD because overall clinical management (clinic visits, laboratory testing) will not be altered by participation in the study. The potential benefit is improved control of the NS. A  Data Monitoring Committee will be established to assess the safety of the GFD in this unique patient cohort.	Specific Aims:    (1) To determine if an elevated plasma zonulin level identifies children with difficult-to-manage NS who are likely to demonstrate a reduction in clinical disease activity in response to implementation of a GFD    (2) To determine the safety, tolerability and effect on quality of life of a GFD in children with difficult-to-manage NS	Primary Endpoint: Change in disease activity - relapse rate and dosage of immunosuppressive medications in response to the gluten-free diet. A ?50% reduction in relapse rate and/or a reduction by ?1 drug in exposure to immunosuppressive medications in response to the GFD will be considered a significant clinical benefit in the management of children with difficult-to-treat NS.    Rationale for primary endpoint:  Determining the prevalence of elevated plasma zonulin levels in children with NS would provide key information before designing an initiating a trial of a gluten-free diet in childhood NS.	2	Entry Criteria: 1. Age 9 months - 18 years    2. Steroid sensitive NS, namely that administration of steroids achieves complete remission of proteinuria    3. Difficult-to-manage NS, be defined as disease that cannot be controlled without incurring intolerable side effects from currently available immunosuppressive agents, namely corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, or rituximab. Patients with biopsy-proven MCD or FSGS will be eligible.                            4. Elevated plasma zonulin level namely above 34 ng/ml    A renal biopsy will not be required and patients with a biopsy diagnosis of MCD or FSGS will be eligible as long as they are steroid sensitive.

If at least 50% of the patients achieve a significant clinical as defined above, then the pilot study will be judged.	Enrollment Plan: Enrollment into the proposed pilot project will be promoted by activities at each participating site. In addition, the investigators will partner with the NephCure Kidney International Accelerating Cures Institute to increase awareness of the disease. This liaison will highlight the availability of the study among community physicians who refer children for care and foster enrollment into the trial in the extended region surrounding each participating site.
353	2018-06-19	55	\N	\N	Goals of Care Intervention in Advanced Heart Failure (GoC HF)	GoC HF	6	The central hypothesis of this proposal is the implementation of a comprehensive communication intervention in Heart Failure (HF) clinics will result in improved patient-provider goals of care (GoC) communication, concordance between patient wishes and therapies received, and reduced costs. We propose to test the efficacy of  (GoC) conversations in advanced (HF) patients. The intervention will be in a multi-site cluster RCT in patients with advanced HF (N=264) after initial referral to mechanical circulatory support transplant centers for advanced heart failures therapies. The overall goal is fill a critical gap in HF care to promote GoC conversations that will result in concordance in care as patients face decisions related to advanced HF therapies.	GoC-HF intervention elements include: 1) Patient educational preparation for HF decisions and advance care planning, patient activation and skills practice; and 2) Provider familiarity with GoC communication for shared decision making in HF. The proposed study will test the effects of the GoC-HF intervention compared to an enhanced usual care using a randomized, 2-group, repeated-measures design.	Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the proportion of patients in GoC-HF who have GoC conversations with their HF providers will be significantly larger when compared to EUC. \nAim 2: To test the hypothesis that patients in GoC-HF compared to EUC will demonstrate: a) improved quality of communication b) concordance between treatment goals and care received c) increased satisfaction with decision-making d) treatment preferences identified and e) stable psychological distress over 12 months of follow-up.\nAim 3: To describe the impact of the GoC intervention on the health care system with respect to: a) health care utilization (number of unscheduled HF visits, HF readmissions, HF related ED visits), b) referrals to supportive services (palliative care, psychological care, rehabilitation), c) estimated health care costs, and d) intervention costs over 12 months\n\nThe overall goal is to fill a critical gap in Heart Failure (HF) care to promote goals of care (GoC) conversations that will result in concordance in care as patients face decisions related to advanced HF therapies. \n\nParticipants in both arms will receive similar contact with study staff. The staff recruiting patients, assigning new patients to provider panels, and collecting outcomes will be blinded to study arm. The GoC intervention will be tested in multiple sites to assess scalability to other clinical sites and patient populations.	The primary outcome is the proportion of GoC conversations that occur after the GoC intervention at a subsequent HF target clinic visit.\nSecondary outcomes are: 1) quality of communication, 2) concordance between goals for treatment and care received, 3) satisfaction/regret with decision making, 4) identified treatment preferences, and 5) psychological distress\n\nThe primary outcome will be determined by asking the patient, two weeks after a HF target visit, if a GoC conversation occurred and if the outline was used. Secondarily, EHR documentation of the GoC conversation by the provider will be determined	1	A total of two hundred sixty-four (N = 264) HF patients (132/arm), new to tertiary care HF centers in the previous 6 months will be enrolled from randomized provider panels. The rationale for recruiting new HF patients is because this intervention is most relevant for such patients as they enter a new phase of HF care, that is characterized by complex treatment related decisions.  Provider Inclusion Criteria: 1) a HF specialty provider (attending physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) at the MCS-HF Clinic who provides direct patient care for those with HF, and 2) has at least 10 new patients assigned to their panel each year. All providers will provide informed consent and are free to refuse participation. Patient inclusion criteria: 1) referral and attendance at a MCS-HF Clinic within the previous 6 months with planned follow-up at that clinic over the ensuing 12 months, 2) diagnosis of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) from either systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and 3) ability to read, write, and speak in English. Patient exclusion criteria: 1) Short BLESSED cognitive score > 10 to rule out significant cognitive impairment [79], 2) diagnosis of a terminal illness with life expectancy of ≤ 1 year not related to heart disease, 3) psychiatric illness that interferes with study participation, and 4) age less than 18 years.	Duke University, Northwestern University, Emory University, and the University of Pennsylvania.	Structured conversations between providers and advanced HF patients, establishing values, goals and preferences, navigating barriers, and treating anxiety and depression	The study will recruit an average of 66 patients/year. The estimated number of HF patients available at the identified PCRC centers is adequate for randomization. Patients will be enrolled over 54 months, with a 1 year follow-up\n\nData analyses, submission to peer-reviewed journals and final reports are expected 55-60 months after human subjects approval.	Patient outcomes will be measured at baseline entry into 1 of 4 mechanical circulatory support (MCS) centers at the next scheduled clinic visit after the patient GoC intervention (target visit), and at 6 and 12 months.	Pending response from PI	Following data cleaning, preliminary analysis will include estimating reliability of scales (Cronbach alpha) and examining distributional properties and characteristics related to assumptions underlying the proposed statistical tests. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, percent) will be used to describe sample demographic and baseline variables. Using t-tests and chi-square tests we will test for baseline differences between treatment groups. Baseline variables that differ significantly between groups and/or predict GoC conversations, will be included as covariates in the outcome analyses. The study procedures and analyses will be conducted according to the intent-to-treat principle, the main analyses will compare all subjects randomized in the intervention group versus all subjects randomized to EUC, without regard to degree of compliance with interventions.\n\nA more detailed statistical plan is available, upon request.	Participants will be recruited from 4 sites, 30 providers. Each provider is expected to enroll 8 patients. The study will over recruit by 20% or 24 additional patients to account for attrition expected from the previous pilot study.
299	2018-03-12	55	\N	\N	Clinical factors that potentiate ototoxicity	Clinical factors that potentiate ototoxicity	6	Aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss is potentiated by inflammatory responses induced by bacterial ligands, as a model for sepsis.  We propose an observational study to determine (1) the risk of hearing loss in infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to cumulative intravenous aminoglycoside dosing, and (2) if (suspected) sepsis potentiates the risk of hearing loss in NICU graduates dosed with aminoglycosides.  An increased incidence of diagnostic hearing loss associated with (i) greater aminoglycoside dosing, and/or (ii) (suspected) sepsis, will predicate the need for ototoxicity monitoring.	NICU infants receiving intravenous gentamicin will be screened for eligibility by the research nurse and enrolled into the study with parental written consent. Participants will have their hearing screened by a research audiologist prior to discharge from the NICU, then return for a follow-up diagnostic hearing evaluation within three months of hospital discharge. For the in-hospital hearing screen, we will measure auditory performance using bedside click-evoked auditory brainstem response (cABR) test and a high frequency distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) assessment (to 10 kHz) prior to discharge.  These tests will be repeated at the follow-up appointment, in addition to other clinical tests of hearing function, i.e., diagnostic auditory brainstem response (ABR) measures to 8 kHz.	In the United States, 12% (~480,000) of ~4 million live births are admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) each year.  As many as 4% of infants (~19,200) discharged from the NICU have severe hearing loss, compared to 0.3% (~10,500) of full-term births, and the etiology of this large difference remains poorly understood.  Congenital and acquired hearing loss during infancy has life-long consequences, with a socioeconomic lifetime burden of >$1 million per individual.  Earlier identification of hearing loss improves the efficacy of rehabilitative strategies and overall quality of life.\nSystemic infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates admitted to the NICU.  Many NICU admissions exhibit risk factors for sepsis and are treated empirically, typically with ampicillin (a β-lactam) and gentamicin (an ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotic), until sepsis is ruled out over the next 48-72 hours.  Patients with confirmed sepsis (or suspected sepsis) remain on antibiotics for 7-10 days or more.  Yet, it remains unclear to what degree the hearing of NICU infants is affected by gentamicin dosing, especially with sepsis. \n\nOur previous work suggests that aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss is potentiated by the inflammatory host response to sepsis or other diseases with long-term antimicrobial treatment, such as necrotizing enterocolitis.  Our long-term goal is to reduce the prevalence and degree of drug-induced hearing loss in infants discharged from the NICU (graduates).  We propose to determine whether the clinical effect of 2 parameters - cumulative gentamicin dosing, and confirmed or suspected sepsis -are associated with increased hearing loss, as in preclinical models.  \nAim 1: Is the risk of hearing loss in NICU graduates greater with higher cumulative gentamicin dosing?\nUnlike preclinical models, little data exists in humans showing the dose-dependency or frequency-selectivity of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss.  Our pilot data suggest that greater aminoglycoside dosing increases the risk of hearing loss in humans.  In a larger cohort, we propose to test the hypothesis that: Diagnostic hearing loss is associated with greater cumulative aminoglycoside dosing in NICU graduates.\nAim 2: Does (suspected) sepsis increase the risk of gentamicin-induced ototoxicity in NICU infants? \nAminoglycosides are essential to treat neonatal sepsis, yet sepsis can induce severe systemic inflammatory responses.  Systemic inflammation potentiates aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in preclinical models, and this ototoxic synergy needs to be verified in humans.  Pilot data show that NICU subjects with clinical signs of inflammation and ≥5 days of gentamicin dosing have a >2-fold greater risk of not passing a frequency-specific hearing assessment.  To validate pilot data in a larger cohort, we will test the hypothesis that: Confirmed or suspected sepsis increases the risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in NICU graduates.\nIf the anticipated data support these 2 hypotheses, these outcomes will predicate refining clinical protocols to reduce aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in vulnerable preterm infants:  If warranted, refined clinical protocols will improve the efficacy of auditory rehabilitation, and/or better preserve life-long auditory function, for NICU graduates to attain optimal listening and spoken language skills to fulfill their educational potential and make lifelong contributions to society.	Aim 1: Is the risk of hearing loss in NICU graduates greater with higher cumulative gentamicin dosing?\nUnlike preclinical models, there is little data in humans showing the dose-dependency and frequency-selectivity of gentamicin-induced hearing loss in humans.  \nExpected Results:  As in pilot data (Cross et al., 20151), we predict: (i) an increased occurrence of in-hospital DPOAE referrals will dose-dependently correlate with increasing cumulative gentamicin dosing; (ii) the occurrence of in-hospital referrals will be significantly greater at higher frequencies (≥4 kHz) than at lower frequencies (<4 kHz), characteristic of ototoxicity, (iii) in-hospital DPOAE referrals will be greater than those from in-hospital automated ABR screens.  These predicted outcomes will demonstrate that: (a) greater gentamicin dosing induces significantly greater degrees of hearing loss, from higher to lower frequencies, demonstrating both the dose-dependency and frequency-selectivity of gentamicin-induced hearing loss in NICU infants for the first time; and (b) at pre- and post-discharge time points, higher frequency DPOAE assessments and tone-specific ABRs will capture more NICU infants with hearing loss, yet had passed both the click ABR, and lower frequency DPOAE assessments.  \nAim 2: Does (suspected) sepsis increase the risk of gentamicin-induced ototoxicity in NICU infants?\nSystemic (non-otologic) inflammation is not associated with hearing loss.  However, pilot data show that NICU subjects with objective signs of (suspected) sepsis and ≥5 days of gentamicin therapy have a 2-fold greater risk of being referred on a frequency-specific DPOAE assessment in-hospital compared to their peers without sepsis (Cross et al., 2015).\nExpected Results:  We predict that:  (i) NICU graduates with (suspected) sepsis or clinical signs of inflammation plus concurrent gentamicin exposure for >4 days will have significantly greater odds of in-hospital, and follow-up, DPOAE referrals, and increased higher frequency hearing loss by diagnostic audiometry compared to all other subjects; (ii) NICU graduates with longer NICU stays (hence likely greater cumulative gentamicin dosing) and (suspected) sepsis/inflammation will have greater degrees of hearing loss (from higher to lower frequencies) than NICU graduates with equivalent gentamicin dosing without indications of (suspected) sepsis/inflammation.  These predicted outcomes will provide evidence-based data to identify alternate (non-aminoglycoside) antimicrobial treatments (where possible) when in the setting of inflammation/sepsis in NICUs and other settings with intravenous aminoglycoside dosing, e.g., cystic fibrosis clinics.  \n\nThese outcomes from both Aims will also show that ototoxic monitoring protocols using higher frequency bandwidths will identify more NICU infants with drug-induced hearing loss, compared to traditional newborn hearing screening assessments.  Findings will also establish whether auditory performance changes following discharge, to reveal stabilized levels, or continuing progression, of hearing loss clinically.  If these anticipated outcomes result in enhanced standard of clinical audiometry in NICUs (i.e., ototoxicity monitoring), this will enable clinicians to identify earlier which at-risk NICU infants have acquired hearing loss (ototoxicity).  Earlier identification of hearing loss in at-risk infants will allow earlier implementation of auditory rehabilitation strategies that are more effective, with better long-term outcomes, when implemented as soon as possible after onset (or identification) of hearing loss.	2	Inclusion criteria for eligible subjects include: >23 and <35 weeks GA at birth and enrolled within 7 days of admission to the NICU.\t\nExclusion criteria include: birth at <23 (or >35) weeks corrected GA; infants receiving palliative care ; a diagnosis of congenital hearing loss, or other known causes of hearing loss, including: hypoxia and infections such as congenital herpes simplex, rubella, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, or meningitis.  Patients with known craniofacial or otologic abnormalities such as midfacial hypoplasia, microtia or aural atresia, Down syndrome, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and exchange transfusions for hyperbilirubinemia will also be excluded due to potential association with hearing loss.	This planned project will take place at 3 US sites: Oregon Health & Science University (Portland Oregon), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee), and Columbia University Medical Center (New York City, New York State).  Each site has a research-oriented NICU that allows us up to recruit 720 subjects (including drop-outs and loss-to-follow-up) to test the above mentioned hypotheses.\n\nThis study is not intended to enroll subjects outside of the USA.

We will conduct group analyses for screening ABRs and DPOAE assessments, separately, using 2-factor repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA; group X frequency) to examine changes in DPOAE assessments in-hospital versus follow-up; and also for correlation between DPOAE assessments and diagnostic ABR measures.  \nWe will use a mixed-effects logistic regression model to estimate odds of hearing loss among those who received ≥4 days of gentamicin dosing compared to those who received <4 days of gentamicin dosing.  This type of modeling allows us to study the effects of dosing on hearing loss after adjusting for co-morbidities (e.g., illness severity through SNAPPE and APGAR scores, gestational age at birth), co-variates such as overall ambient sound levels in the NICU, co-therapeutics (vancomycin or loop diuretics), and subject demographics, in terms of Odds ratios (OR).  The use of a mixed-effects model will allow the flexibility to account for any between-site variability.  The mixed model is also useful to make inferences about individuals in addition to population averages, and the influence of covariates on a specific subject's response.  We will also examine if there is a significant trend of increasing odds of hearing loss with increasing gentamicin dosing by stratifying cumulative dosing into tertiles or quartiles as the data allows, as described previously (Garinis et al., 2017).  Finally, we will perform model diagnostics and examine model fit statistics such as a C-statistic and/or Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and/or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) in order to examine how well the model fits the data.\n\nFor Aim 2: Does (suspected) inflammation increase the risk of ototoxicity in NICU infants?\nWe will examine patient demographics and maternal health status variables, overall and by site in an effort to examine differences between sites.  We will use a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a random intercept for each site to account for site variability, to estimate individual main effects of gentamicin dosing and (suspected) sepsis or inflammation, the synergistic effect of both factors on hearing loss, and adjust for potential confounders such as ambient noise and other co-morbidities, covariates of interest (e.g., vancomycin or loop diuretics), and demographics among NICU infants.  We will also examine the synergistic effect under different dose cut-points (e.g. ≥4 days of gentamicin dosing, ≥5 days of gentamicin dosing) in an attempt to quantify the dose with the highest risk of hearing loss.  Finally, we will perform model diagnostics and examine model fit statistics such as a C-statistic and/or AIC and/or BIC (as in Aim 1) in order to examine how well the model fits the data.\t\nTo examine the effects of potential misclassification, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis among those infants that do not meet the clinical criteria for sepsis, suspected sepsis or sepsis syndrome to better estimate the amount of potential attenuation of the association.	The power analyses revealed that ~720 subjects are needed to test the hypothesis in Aim 2, and this provides more than sufficient statistical power (>80%) to test the hypothesis in Aim 1.  To prospectively enroll 720 subjects over 4 years, we will approach parents/guardians of eligible preterm births at 3 sites.  Based on our pilot study1, we need to screen and approach 2.5x as many eligible admissions to meet the enrollment goal, ~720 subjects, which includes those lost to follow up.  We have sufficient eligible patients at each site to meet this eligible/consented ratio and achieve our recruitment goals over 4 years.  All sites will begin enrolling by 10/2019, 6 months following the anticipated start of the funding period, 4/2019.  \n\nAt OHSU, the number of live births was 2474 in 2016.  The number of preterm births with a gestational age (GA) >23 and <35 weeks admitted to OHSU's NICU was 234 in 2016, and 187 in 2017.  Of these, 226 (in 2016) and 180 (in 2017) would have been eligible for this study (after exclusion criteria applied).  Thus, OHSU has sufficient admissions (203) to meet OHSU's eligibility screening goal of 125 (= 2.5 x peak annual enrollment goal [50]).  OHSU will enroll 4-5 subjects/month, a total of 210 subjects over 48 months (4.3 subjects/month).\n\nThe NICU population at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) has ~900 NICU admissions/year with ~380 preterm admissions <35 weeks GA/year.  Of these, 330 (in 2016) and 405 (in 2017) would have been eligible for this study (after exclusion criteria applied).  Thus, CUMC has sufficient admissions to meet the eligibility screening goal of 125 (= 2.5 x peak annual enrollment goal [50]) to meet CUMC enrollment goals.  CUMC will enroll 4-5 subjects/month, a total of 210 subjects over 48 months (4.3 subjects/month).\n\nThe number of NICU admissions at Vanderbilt (VUMC) in 2016 was 1486, and 1641 in 2017.  The number of those between >23 and <35 weeks GA was 598 in 2016, and 596 in 2017 (after exclusion criteria applied).  Thus, VUMC has sufficient eligible admissions (~346) to meet VUMC screening goals (188 = 2.5 x maximum annual enrollment goal [75]) to meet the peak annual enrollment goal for VUMC (75).  VUMC to enroll 6-7 subjects/month, a total of 300 subjects over 48 months (6.25 subjects/month)\nThese data are based on census size for each site, and experience from the pilot study at OHSU, where 93 subjects were enrolled over 18 months (5.1 subjects/month).  \n\n\nRecruitment efforts to meet our enrollment goal will be based on consenting parents/guardians of infants admitted to the NICU who meet eligibility criteria during initial screening by research nurses shortly after admission.  We recognize that not all potential enrollees will be successfully consented, and therefore we have determined, from our pilot study, that 2.5x as many families must be approached to reach enrollment goals for each site.  Our cohort analyses have determined that this is feasible for each site.\n1.\tCross et al., Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol 79, 1915-1919 (2015).
47	2016-12-05	55	\N	\N	Long-term follow-up of HALT PKD Study A Cohort	HALT Study	6	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the growth and expansion of multiple cysts throughout both kidneys, leading to loss of kidney function frequently culminating in ESRD, and symptoms such as pain, bloating, hematuria, and cyst infections that are directly associated with the size (total volume) of the kidneys. A large body of natural history data clearly associates increases in TKV with a decline in renal function; however, there is still an ongoing controversy as to whether therapeutic interventions that slow the rate of expansion of TKV also slow the loss of renal function. The HALT PKD Study investigators recently reported that intensive blood pressure control significantly slowed the rate of growth of total kidney volume (TKV; the primary study endpoint) after 5 years (Schrier et. al., N Engl J Med. 2014 Dec 11;371(24):2255-66; PMID:25399733).  The overall change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was not significant although the chronic eGFR slope, after accounting for an initial acute decrease in eGFR due to the blood pressure intervention, was of borderline significance (P = 0.05).  Because eGFR remains relatively stable in early ADPKD, despite the ongoing increase in TKV, we propose that a longer period of eGFR follow-up is necessary in order to detect the slowing of eGFR slope due to intensive BP reduction.  The objective of this study will be to follow the HALT PKD Study A participants for another 5 years to determine whether the beneficial effect of intensive BP control on total kidney volume translates to long-term preservation of eGFR.        HALT-A was a 2 x 2 factorial, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial comparing treatment with lisinopril/telmisartan versus lisinopril/placebo, and standard (120/70 to 130/80 mm Hg) versus low (95/60 to 110/75 mm Hg) blood pressure target in 558 hypertensive 15 to 49 year-old ADPKD patients with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Enrollment began in 2006, and patients were followed for 5 to 8 years with serum creatinine measurements every 6 months and TKV by MRI at baseline, 2, 4 and 5 years. There was no difference in outcomes between combined telmisartan/lisinopril vs. lisinopril/placebo treatment groups; however, intensive BP control significantly slowed the growth of TKV as discussed above.	The proposed study design is novel, utilizing two different study consortia with substantial overlap of investigators and study sites.  However, the specific aims of each consortium and proposal are different. The CRISP consortium includes 4 patient clinical centers (PCC) at Kansas (Site PI: Alan Yu), Mayo (Site PI: Vicente Torres), University of Alabama (Site PI: Michal Mrug), and University of Chicago (Site PI: Arlene Chapman), (previously at Emory University (Site PI: Frederic Rabhari-Oskoui), and a DCC at the University of Pittsburgh (Site PI: Douglas Landsittel).  The CRISP 4 five-year extension will begin shortly (1 RO1 DK113111-01, expected start date 4/1/2017).         The HALT PKD consortium includes 7 patient clinical centers at Tufts Medical Center (Site PI: Dr. Ronald Perrone), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Site PI: Dr. Ted Steinman), U. of Colorado Denver (Site PI: Robert Schrier who has retired, being replaced by Godela Brosnahan), Kansas (Site PI: Alan Yu), Mayo (Site PI: Vicente Torres), Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Site PI: William Braun who has retired, being replaced by Richard Fatica), Emory University (Site PI: Frederic Rabhari-Oskoui, now transferred in part to the University of Chicago (Site PI: Arlene Chapman), and a DCC at the University of Pittsburgh (Site PI: Kaleab Abebe).      This proposal will focus on protocol-based follow-up of HALT Study A subjects that are not already being followed by CRISP centers; these centers are Tufts Medical Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and U. of Colorado Denver.        Schedule of assessments shown below:    PCC:  patient clinical center    PV: phone visit	Aim 1. Obtain complete follow-up of HALT Study A participants in order to be able to ascertain whether the reduction in TKV growth due to intensive BP control translated to long-term improvement in renal function outcomes and the other complications of ADPKD.        Study endpoints:  Comparison of  1) long-term eGFR decline between participants who were originally randomized to low and standard blood pressure arms and 2) long-term eGFR decline between the trial and extended followup.  We will also be able to determine the effect of achieved blood pressure on long term eGFR decline         Aim 2. In collaboration with Dr. Alan Yu and the CRISP4 consortium, develop improved models to predict GFR trajectories and progression to ESRD. Existing logistic regression and trajectory models will be refined and new approaches such as artificial neural network and classification tree models developed, using CRISP data for model fitting and HALT-A data for external validation.	The primary endpoint will be eGFR slopes as described below.    Secondary endpoints including PKD complications, mortality, development of ESRD, and cardiovascular events.	1	Any subject who participated in HALT PKD Study A is eligible to participate.  All subjects will be recontacted and consent will be obtained.	Not provided	There will be no intervention; this will be a long-term follow-up of the HALT Study A cohort to ascertain whether the intensive blood pressure control arm resulted in a slowing of the rate of loss of eGFR.  These patients will be recontacted and consented for an additional 5 years of follow-up. Patients will undergo a full study visit at the Patient Care Center (PCC) every other year (0, 24 and 48 months) (Figure). Interval medical history, medication use, PKD-related complications including pain, hematuria, infection and nephrolithiasis will be ascertained, and corroborated by reviewing patients' medical records as needed. Blood will be collected for serum creatinine measurements to determine eGFR using the CKD-EPI equation. In years without a PCC visit, patients will have blood drawn locally for annual serum creatinine measurement ('Lab visits'). Study coordinators will conduct quarterly telephone calls to maintain study participation and ensure full ascertainment of outcomes (Phone visit, PV). Data will be collected centrally, managed and analyzed by the HALT Data Coordinating Center under the direction of Dr. Abebe.  The Data Coordinating Centers for both HALT (Dr. Abebe) and CRISP (Dr. Landsittel) reside at the Univ. of Pittsburgh allowing for close coordination and simplicity of data sharing, once data-sharing memos are established.	Not provided	Not provided	\N	The analytical plan for the follow up period will be similar to that used in the original HALT PKD trial.  For Study A, the outcome of interest will be estimated GFR.  We will utilize piecewise linear mixed models with separate slopes for the following periods: 1) the acute phase (first 4 months) of the randomized clinical trial; 2) the chronic phase (4 months through the end of followup) of the trial; 3) the period between the trial and extended followup studies; and 4) the remainder of the followup study. This parameterization will allow us to compare 1) long-term eGFR decline between participants who were originally randomized to low and standard blood pressure arms and 2) long-term eGFR decline between the trial and extended followup.  We will also be able to determine the effect of achieved blood pressure on long term eGFR decline.  Secondary outcomes in Study A will be analyzed in a similar fashion.  We will include time-varying covariates to distinguish the clinical trial period from the extended followup period.    We will assess the degree of lost-to-follow up due to disease progression.  If significant, we will use models that account for informative censoring in order to produce unbiased estimates.	All HALT A study sites retain detailed records on participants associated with their sites.  Communication regarding their HALT PKD medication assignment and individualized study outcome reports were provided to all participants in 12/2014.  Further, many of these participants receive ongoing medical care at their HALT PKD study site. Thus, contact info is relatively current.

All 4 treatment arms fall within treatment and dosing strategies that are considered standard of care	First patient enrolled is expected in June 2019 followed by one year of enrollment.  Site closure and database lock are anticipated for August/September 2020.	Participants will be administered study drug for a treatment period of up to 7 days. Short term followup will take place at days 14, 21 and 28 if not discharged from the ICU.	\N	General Approach: As a first step in the statistical analyses of this study, we will summarize baseline demographic characteristics of participants enrolled in this study, as well as summarize the clinical characteristics and safety profile of the participant sample. This will be followed by analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes, and safety data. Finally, we will perform basic statistical analysis on the exploratory specific aims.\nPrimary outcome: Daily fentanyl dose\n\nPrimary Outcome: The mean daily dose of fentanyl (in mcg/kg) over a maximum 7 days of mechanical ventilation (or extubation, whichever is first) will be compared between the placebo arm and the 3 combined dexmedetomidine arms.  Daily doses per participant will be treated as a continuous outcome. The normality of these data will be assessed with histograms and Q-Q plots. Because each participant will have multiple, repeated measures of daily fentanyl (up to 7 days per participant), the difference in mean daily dose between the placebo arm and the combined dexmedetomidine arms will be compared using a random effects, mixed model, with random intercepts per participant, and a treatment indicator. In addition to considering the difference in mean daily fentanyl use by treatment regimen (placebo v. dexmedetomidine arms combined), we will also consider the trend of fentanyl use over the 7 days of mechanical ventilation by considering time (as continuous), treatment, and treatment by time interaction terms in the random effects regression model.  In the case of non-normally distributed outcome measures, we will consider normal transformations of daily fentanyl use prior to creating the random effect regression model, as well as robust methods for estimating the standard errors of the model coefficients. Group differences in daily fentanyl use will be presented as group mean +/- 95% CI obtained from the random effects model coefficients. Adjusted analyses controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics may be performed if baseline imbalances between the treatment arms are present. No missing outcome measures will be imputed; however, multiple imputation methods will be used to estimate missing data for the covariates. The random effects model as described above is robust under the assumption of data missingness at random. Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed, whereby missing daily fentanyl doses are replaced with extreme values seen from the distribution of fentanyl doses seen in this population to determine how sensitive the model results are to non-ignorable missingness.	A separate detailed recruitment and retention plan will be included in the manual of procedures (MOP). General strategies to support recruitment will include:\n•\tRandomizing a total of 48 participants under the age of 18.\n•\tScreening patients in the PICU to determine eligibility.\n•\tRecording participant sex, race, and ethnicity and monitoring regularly to ensure equitable enrollment.\n•\tIdentifying potential participants by executing clinic workflow alerts via their local electronic health record system, and other notification tools at strategic points of patient care.\n•\tIncorporating study-specific decision tools for the participants, clinicians, and family enhancing transparency and confidence during the informed consent process to ensure the participant experiences a well-informed consenting process\nFirst Site Activated: 6/24/19\nAll Sties Activated: 9/1/19\nSite enrollment expectation: 1 pt/quarter, anticipate all pts enrolled by 6/29/20\nRecruitment efforts are essential to meeting enrollment goal.

This proposal is an unblinded, randomized prospective trial of infliximab for neurosarcoidosis.   A standard parallel group design, randomizing 2:1, infliximab to prednisone patients is proposed.  The primary efficacy endpoint for this study would be improvement in clinical, spinal fluid markers, or targeted MRI enhancing abnormalities following treatment.  The anticipated assessment of treatment for each patient would be at three and six months.  Statistical support will be used to compare standard prednisone therapy, 1 mg/kg daily oral prednisone to infliximab therapy, in a regimen of infliximab 5 mg/kg at initiation, two weeks, four weeks, and then monthly for a total of six months.	The primary objective is to test the efficacy of infliximab relative to placebo using a non-inferiority hypothesis.     The primary endpoint will be improvement in a targeted clinical objective physical examination finding, normalization of spinal fluid pleocytosis, or resolution of an enhancing MRI abnormality of brain or spinal cord following treatment.   The secondary objective will be to show that infliximab infusions administered in this regimen have fewer side effects compared to oral prednisone. The rate of contraindication to continue therapy (e.g., dose limiting toxicities, serious adverse events, etc.) will be tested in a superiority hypothesis.

Patients will be treated and followed for six months.  Enrollment of 100 patients is anticipated to be completed in three years.  Study is anticipated to be completed in four years.	Patients will be treated and followed for six months.	Allen J Aksamit MD has no conflicts to disclose.	The statistical plan, particularly the selection of the final study design, is expected to occur through consultation with the TIN. Given the study is unblinded (i.e., avoids the use of a double blind, double dummy design), mitigating bias particularly with discontinuation of therapy and possible crossover to infliximab is a design consideration. Preliminary sample size calculations are based on an non-inferiority test at the alpha=0.025 (to results in traditional 95% CIs for the estimated difference). Assuming the prednisone group will have 75% clinical success at 6 months and the infliximab arm will be at 85% due to continuation, there is 80% power to conclude non-inferiority with 58 and 29 participants in the infliximab and prednisone arms, respectively. This calculation is based on a limit of non-inferiority of -0.15, which is based on a 20% reduction of efficacy for the prednisone arm. Much larger sample sizes (impractically large) would be required to test for superiority unless the primary endpoint was modified to being a combination of efficacy and safety. We would be interested in discussions on alternative study designs and endpoints that will help minimize the sample size while providing a rigorous, interpretable study conclusion.	\N
356	2018-06-21	5	\N	t	Development and Testing of a Pediatric Cervical Spine Injury Risk Assessment Tool	Pediatric Cervical Spine Injury Risk Assessment Tool	6	Problem: Cervical spine injuries (CSI) are serious, but rare events in children.  In contrast, use of spinal precautions for trauma transport and radiographic evaluation for CSI in the emergency department (ED) are common and associated with adverse effects.  As a result, millions of children who have no CSI are exposed to harm with no demonstrable benefit.  The nation's EMS systems need a Pediatric CSI Risk Assessment Tool that can be used to reduce the number of children who are transported in spinal precautions and irradiated unnecessarily.  Leonard et al. and the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) retrospectively identified 8 risk factors that predict CSI in children.  We also established the infrastructure to prospectively collect paired observations from EMS and ED providers and determined the test accuracies of the PECARN CSI risk factors.  Goal: Using prospective observational data and information from a cognitive task analysis (ACTA) conducted with subject matter experts and relevant end-users, we will use a user-centered design approach to develop and test a Pediatric CSI Risk Assessment Tool that can be used by EMS and ED providers to determine which children warrant spinal precautions and cervical spine imaging after blunt trauma.	Methodology: We will collect prospective observational data from EMS and ED providers regarding CSI risk factors for children who undergo emergency evaluation after blunt trauma and follow enrolled subjects for 28 days to determine CSI status.  The study will occur in two phases: development (13,333 children; 240 children with CSI) and validation (8,889 children; 160 children with CSI).  We will also capitalize on the research infrastructure to conduct an ACTA and tool prototype testing that will inform the iterative tool design to ensure that the tool is useable by EMS and ED providers.  Evaluation: With data from the development cohort, a useable clinical decision support tool will be constructed that achieves >95% sensitivity, as well as adequate specificity (>40%) in the prediction of CSI.  Subsequently, we will determine the performance characteristics of the tool in the independent validation cohort and in a cohort that has EMS provider observations.	1) Develop the Pediatric CSI Risk Assessment Tool in children with blunt trauma and 2) Validate the Pediatric CSI Risk Assessment Tool in a separate population of children with blunt trauma; and 3) Validate the Pediatric CSI Risk Assessment Tool with EMS observations from both the development and validation cohorts.	The ultimate output from this project will be a set of specifications for the Pediatric CSI Risk Assessment Tool that will include a validated clinical decision rule, validated tool designs and functions, and recommendations for implementation.	2	Children will be included if they meet any one of the following: 1) the institution's triage criteria for trauma team activation, 2) the transporting EMS agency's field triage criteria for spinal precautions or 3) the evaluating ED physician believes the patient is at sufficient risk for CSI to warrant cervical spine imaging.  We will exclude children if: 1) they are only injured by penetrating trauma mechanism, 2) they are transferred away from the study site to another facility for definitive care, 3) the patient is in police custody or is a ward of the state, or 4) there is a substantial language barrier with the parent or guardian.

479	2019-03-13	20	\N	t	The International Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Comparative Effectiveness Research Alliance: The INSIDER Study	INSIDER	6	The proposed INSIDER (INternational SubarachnoID Hemorrhage Comparative Effectiveness Research Alliance) has been designed as a seven-year prospective, observational, international, and multicenter study to determine the effect of practice variability on outcome after aSAH, to develop an outcome prediction model, and build a knowledge treasury to support future SAH research. We are planning to submit an application to NINDS in response to FOA PAR-19-171: Comparative Effectiveness Research in Clinical Neurosciences (UG3/UH3 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) for the June, 2019 deadline.	All patients presenting with aSAH to the participating sites will be screened for study eligibility. The methods for recruitment of subjects in the study will not be coercive and will not involve any restrictions on socio-demographic factors such as gender or ethnicity.  The centers chosen are located in areas made up of a diversity of ethnic groups. The centers also treat patients of diverse ethnic and gender background. Thus, adequate representation of the under-represented groups and women should be provided. A screen failure log will be kept to record all patients that are screened but not enrolled into the study. The EC will confirm that all participating centers are tertiary care facilities with a large volume of SAH patients. The EC will constantly evaluate screening and enrollment at each site. The EC will work with site PIs and research coordinators to develop strategies for efficient recruitment and mechanisms to evaluate them. The goal of the study is to achieve complete, and accurate follow-up for the 18-month follow-up period. Subjects will be scheduled for a telephone interview at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after symptom onset. In addition, they will be contacted at 1½, 5, 10, and 16 months for reports of SAEs, to capture early follow up information and to make arrangements for the subsequent and final telephone interview.	Specific Aim 1: To assess between-hospital and regional variability in management of SAH patients worldwide and leverage this variability as an asset for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) to determine best practices and aid precision medicine. There is practice variability and it is unclear what its effects are on outcome. We hypothesize that aSAH outcomes may be explained by centers using different approaches to important aspects of clinical care. We are particularly interested in assessing 3 main interventions: timing of aneurysm treatment; rescue therapy for DCI; and fluid management.\n  \nSpecific Aim 2: To develop and validate an outcome prediction model for SAH that could be generalizable, and to define patient profiles which predict effectiveness of specific interventions. We will endeavor to determine which tests, neuromonitoring modalities, treatments, and services are effective and appropriate for which aSAH patients, and use this evidence to recommend practices that offer the best value. We will be incorporating variables of interest including baseline demographics, clinical and radiological severity scores, time series physiological data, and patient-centered outcomes. We hypothesize that this outcome prediction validation will permit appropriate selection and stratification of patients for clinical trials, and contribute to the development of a new taxonomy for aSAH. \n\nSpecific Aim 3: To create a high-quality, public and comprehensive SAH knowledge treasury that integrates clinical, imaging, and outcome information from subjects, and provides resources to support further SAH research. Data fields will be built following the recommendations of the NINDS Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysms and SAH Common Data Element (CDE) Project. The INSIDER data repository will be made public and yield an open-source resource for current and future SAH research and international collaboration. \n\nExploratory Aim: To study imaging, proteomic, and genetic biomarkers that will improve \nclassification of SAH, and permit further refinement of outcome prediction algorithms. We hypothesize that validated imaging, proteomic, and genetic biomarkers will permit improved classification, beyond traditional categories of low- and high-grade aSAH.	The clinical endpoints are as follow:\n-Primary: modified Rankin scale (mRs) at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months\n-Secondary endpoints: Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Assessment Tool (SAHOT) at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months	1	Inclusion criteria\n•\tAt least 18 years of age.\n•\tOnset of new neurological signs of SAH within 24 hours of enrollment.\n•\tClinical signs consistent with the diagnosis of SAH including severe thunderclap headache, cranial nerve      abnormalities, decreased level of consciousness, meningismus and focal neurological deficits.\n•\tSAH demonstrated by head CT.\n•\tPresence of saccular or fusiform aneurysm(s) as revealed by DSA or CTA in a location that explains the SAH. \n•\tSigned and dated informed written consent by subject or his/her legally-authorized representative (LAR).\n Exclusion criteria\n•\tTime of symptom onset cannot be reliably assessed or > 24 hours.\n•\tNo demonstrable aneurysm by DSA (digital subtraction angiogram) or CTA (CT angiogram).\n•\tEvidence of traumatic or mycotic aneurysm by DSA.\n•\tTraumatic SAH\n•\tSevere prior physical disability that precludes evaluation of clinical outcome measures, i.e., modified Rankin Scale (mRs) score > 2.\n•\tMajor pre-morbid debilitating psychiatric or neurological disorder that would interfere with follow-up and the validity of outcome assessments.\n•\tSevere terminal disease with estimated life expectancy less than 6 months.\n•\tInability to return for the follow up visits or telephone interviews.	INSIDER will be a collaboration with the Neurocritical Care Research Network (NCRN), which is constituted by more than 230 sites from 47 countries. We will select approximately 50 sites with experience caring for aSAH patients from all continents. The EC will ensure that the selected sites allow for enrollment of a diverse population based on gender and ethnicity. Sites will be divided into 2 tiers: those where basic data will be collected (Primary Sites - PS), and those where a more comprehensive data set will be obtained (Comprehensive Sites - CS). Data from PS will include: demographic and clinical course data; routine clinical biomarkers; imaging: head CT scans, DSA, and CTA; outcome data at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. Data from CS will include: same data as PS plus high-frequency (waveforms) and multimodal systemic and neuromonitoring; biospecimens; and multimodal MRI of brain at 3 months.\nPrior to acceptance, clinical sites are required to complete a site assessment/protocol feasibility questionnaire application. In addition, sites may be visited by one of the PIs or their staff or teleconferences with one of the local PIs, or their designee, may be scheduled prior to the candidate site being accepted as an official recruiting site. All this will serve to verify site-specific components such as the likelihood of successful subject recruitment, research team composition, and patient care facilities	This is an observational study.

72	2016-12-06	55	\N	\N	Targeted next-generation sequencing (TNGS) to improve neonatal outcome	TNGS Study	2	Congenital abnormalities and genetic diseases are a leading cause of infant mortality in the US[i]. While newborn screening (NBS) has dramatically reduced infant morbidity and mortality for some genetic disorders, these improvements have not had a significant impact on most Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU), where almost 400,000 infants are admitted each year[ii]. Between 10 to 25% of all NICU admissions are the result of a genetic disease, with infants staying in the hospital approximately 40% longer than non-genetic cases. Due to the non-specific presentation of many of these genetic disorders, many infants do not receive a definitive diagnosis in a timely fashion. Our primary data from Rare Pharma demonstrate that infants with a rare genetic disorder have a 5-year gap between disease onset and diagnosis with a corresponding delay in pharmacologic treatment and subsequent functional disability. While whole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing may offer comprehensive genetic testing, their use in the neonatal period raises a multitude of ethical considerations.  Namely, their potential to diagnose adult-onset diseases jeopardizes an infant's autonomy and right to an 'open future'. Thus, we have enhanced the concept of NBS to identify diseases whose timely treatment in the newborn period can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality by introducing a rapid, targeted, next-generation sequencing (TNGS) panel that has the potential to expand molecular diagnosis (MDx) and precision medicine for hundreds of genetic diseases[vi]. This newly designed TNGS panel interrogates standard dried blood spots for 1,000 genes matched to phentoypes affecting the neonatal population and has the potential to detect up 98% of clinically relevant sequence variants for Mendelian inherited disorders with the highest morbidity and mortality. We hypothesize that the targeted use of this technology in high risk neonates will improve outcomes while reducing total costs by permitting a more rapid and definitive diagnosis and accelerating orphan drug development by quickly matching infants to appropriate clinical trials and FDA approved drugs. Here, we propose to prospectively examine the diagnostic efficacy of a precision neonatal medicine approach through a public-private partnership among four leading CTSA sites and industry to further develop rapid TNGS from dried blood spots. We will characterize the time to diagnosis and initiation of therapy in 1,000 critically ill neonates, while developing a comprehensive, scalable and affordable system for identifying additional genetic variants that are predictive of outcome and can serve as biomarkers for future drug development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to examine the clinical utility and operational infrastructure of a neonatal gene panel in critically ill newborns in order to determine if we can provide a more timely diagnosis and better care at lower cost, establishing the foundation for a CTSA wide Neonatal Precision Medicine Program.	Study staff will screen eligible infants in each NICU daily. These four sites admit well over 2,000 infants to the NICU each year and we estimate that approximately 80% of families approached for the study will consent for TNGS compared to the poor enrollment rates seen with WGS due to its associated ethical and moral challenges. Informed consent will be obtained from the parent(s) following a single IRB approval with reliance at each institution.      We will enroll 500 neonates from four level IV NICUs and examine the clinical utility and accuracy of TNGS (with WGS to confirm that all neonatal related actionable variants are found) in addition to standard NBS and single gene testing. The primary outcome measure is time to diagnosis and the accuracy of this diagnosis with secondary outcome measures of major neonatal morbidity, survival, and 2-year assessment of relevant morbidities (using parental diaries and questionnaires). All neonates admitted to the four level IV NICUs >24 weeks gestational age and BW >600g with a number of signs/symptoms of an underlying disorder will be enrolled (e.g. hypotonia, poor feeding, hearing loss, etc). There will be no evidence of congenital infection or other medical conditions that might significantly impact survival and long term outcome (lethal congenital anomalies, etc.). Neonates will be stratified by birth weight and gestational age (since the most premature infants will have the longest LOS). The study teams at these institutions have a long and successful history of conducting clinical trials in this unique population. High risk neonates will prospectively receive rapid TNGS (mother- father-infant trios) in addition to standard diagnostic tests with NBS and single gene testing. WGS will also be performed on all infants to confirm accuracy and to establish potential false negative rates. We will then examine LOS and total hospital costs, as well as the time to treatment if an appropriate therapy exists (FDA approved treatment or clinical trial for Rare Diseases). Dr. Davis has significant experience working with international Rare Disease Networks and has access to resources at NCATS (and throughout the CTSA network) and FDA that will be extremely valuable in this study. All clinical testing, therapy, and information relevant to the infant's care will be entered in a password protected electronic database (StudyTrax) as we have used previously.  Finally, an additional 500 infants will be studied with WGS alone by Dr. Kingsmore (funded by 5U19HD077693-03) as an additional group to help determine specificity, sensitivity and cost effectiveness of the TNGS panel.  These infants will also help to inform and refine the existing TNGS panel to include additional relevant conditions not previously recognized. The results of the WGS will be limited to those gene disorders associated with actionable variants in the NICU and no other data will be shared.    Collaborative Efforts: Dr. Jonathan Davis of Tufts University, Chief of Newborn Medicine, Chair of the Neonatal Advisory Committee at FDA, and Director of the International Neonatal Consortium; Dr. Jill Maron, Director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts University and an expert in salivary genomic profiles; Dr. Jerry Vockley of University of Pittsburgh, Chief Division of Medical Genetics, an internationally recognized leader in medical genetics and inborn errors of metabolism; Dr. Stephen Kingsmore of the Rady Pediatric Genomic and Systems Medicine Institute in San Diego, who is pioneering ultra-rapid WGS for diagnosis of genetic diseases; and  Dr. Bruce Gelb from Mt Sinai School of Medicine who has significant expertise in genomics and precision medicine - all are uniquely positioned to collaborate on this translational research project. A Public-Private Partnership will be created with Parabase Genomics in Boston, a leading group in the development of novel genetic diagnostics. Integration of neonatal medicine, medical genetics and genomic medicine is essential in developing the optimal genetic testing paradigm for the NICU. Each center will accrue 125 neonates per year during the first two years of this study for a total of 500 infants who will represent significant racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity and then Dr. Kingsmore's cohort of 500 infants will give 1,000 infants total. Dr. Vockley will guide the genetic interpretation of results, while Dr. Davis serves as PI responsible for coordinating the study to ensure synergy/prioritization with NCAT's six priority areas on a national level as well as interaction with the pharmaceutical industry to identify appropriate clinical trials for any needed intervention. The Biostatistical Support Group from the Tufts CTSI will provide data support (data checks, quality control, etc), and overall biostatistical analyses of the significant amount of data that will be generated. The CTSA centers will capture total cost of care of infants participating in the study vs. standard of care. Dr. Peter Neumann and his team are nationally renowned health economists in the Tufts CTSI and will analyze cost data from each infant. The metrics will include medical efficiency of this testing paradigm vs standard of care in identifying any genetic abnormalities and prioritizing them for inclusion in future testing, capturing cost and clinical outcomes of early intervention including the benefit of widespread genetic testing in the NICU compared to selective utilization. Research results are intended to be published in peer reviewed journals, shared with industry leaders for inclusion in genetic testing and drug discovery/development efforts, and enhance pediatric clinical trial accrual. The geographically diverse CTSA consortium team anticipates sharing data regionally and nationally at medical meetings consisting of neonatologists, clinical geneticists and genetic sequencing experts as each of our key opinion CTSA leaders span the key sectors of influence necessary for adoption of a new technology for improved NICU diagnosis and care.	Congenital abnormalities and genetic diseases are a leading cause of infant mortality. While routine newborn screening (NBS) has dramatically reduced infant morbidity and mortality, these improvements have not fully translated in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) where 10-25% of all neonates are admitted with an underlying genetic disorder. Hospital length of stay for these infants is approximately 40% longer than those without a genetic disorder. Due to the non-specific presentation of many genetic disorders, affected neonates either do not receive a definitive diagnosis in a timely fashion or are misdiagnosed completely. Our primary data demonstrate that infants with a rare genetic disorder have a 5-year gap between disease onset and definitive diagnosis. This results in a corresponding delay in treatment and development of significant functional disability. Adopting the philosophy of NBS to utilize standard dried blood spots to assess newborns for diseases and conditions where timely intervention in the neonatal period dramatically reduces morbidity and mortality, we have developed a rapid, targeted, next-generation sequencing (TNGS) panel that has the potential to expand molecular diagnosis (MDx) and precision medicine. We hypothesize that TNGS could transform empiric, phenotype-driven management into genotype-informed treatment plans to improve outcomes. A critical barrier to implementing this technology is a lack of prospective studies examining the clinical utility of precision medicine in the NICU. If the TNGS method can detect a significant number of abnormalities in a more rapid and cost-effective manner, it could easily be adopted nationally and then internationally through the International Neonatal Consortium (INC). This approach is preferable to Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) where significant moral, ethical and financial issues have been identified. Here, we propose a prospective study to test the effectiveness of a TNGS panel compared to standard single gene testing and NBS, as well as WGS, in neonates admitted to four NICUs at CTSA sites. This study is critically important and is required to advance the expanding field of molecular diagnosis in a high risk and special population. We have the following Aims:    Specific Aim 1: Determine if the TNGS panel will shorten the time to a definitive diagnosis of a genetic disorder. One thousand infants will be enrolled from four level IV NICUs examining the diagnostic TNGS panel (mother/father/infant trios) in addition to standard NBS and single gene testing. Our primary hypothesis is time to diagnosis and accuracy of diagnosis will be significantly shorter with the TNGS panel. Secondary outcome measures include major neonatal morbidity, survival, and 2-year assessment of relevant morbidities. All high risk neonates admitted to the NICUs with clinical exam findings concerning for a genetic disorder including but not limited to hypotonia, poor feeding, and hearing loss will be approached for enrollment. Infants must be ?24 weeks gestation, with a birth weight >600g and have no evidence of congenital infection or other medical conditions that might significantly impact survival and long-term outcome (i.e. lethal congenital anomalies). Five hundred infants will receive both: 1) rapid TNGS (which can identify 1,000 neonatal related actionable variants) in addition to clinically indicated standard diagnostic tests to diagnose monogenic disorders of unknown etiology and 2) WGS in order to confirm the accuracy of the TNGS panel and document any false negatives. The time to diagnosis of each methodology will be examined.  Finally, an additional 500 infants will be studied with WGS alone by Dr. Kingsmore (funded by 5U19HD077693-03) in order to help establish sensitivity, specificity and cost effectiveness of the TNGS panel as well as update the TNGS panel depending on the discovery of new and pertinent variants.    Specific Aim 2: Determine if the TNGS panel will reduce length of hospital stay (LOS) and total costs. LOS and total hospital costs will be examined in the cohort of neonates identified in Aim 1. Infants will be stratified by birth weight and gestational age since the most premature infants will have the longest LOS and highest costs. Neonates will also be classified into three diagnostic categories: 1) confirmed genetic diagnosis, 2) no abnormalities detected, and 3) variants of unknown significance. We hypothesize that widespread use of the neonatal TNGS panel will significantly reduce total NICU costs.    Specific Aim 3: Determine if the TNGS panel will shorten the duration to a specific therapeutic intervention for a genetic disorder. Over 30% of genes from the TNGS panel are known to have open clinical trials (114 genes) or FDA approved orphan drugs (195 genes). In this Aim, the time from initial diagnosis to the initiation of a specific therapeutic intervention or entry into a multisite clinical trial will be assessed.  We hypothesize that use of a TNGS panel will significantly shorten the time to diagnosis specifically for disorders with current active clinical trials.    This proposal will determine the clinical utility and cost effectiveness of targeted next generation sequencing in a high risk and vulnerable population of neonates in four CTSA centers that are ethnically and racially diverse. This specific approach is designed to enhance traditional diagnostic testing and significantly improve outcome while avoiding the pitfalls of WGS and the inherent gaps in coverage associated with WES.	The primary outcome measure is time to diagnosis and the accuracy of this diagnosis with secondary outcome measures of major neonatal morbidity, survival, and 2-year assessment of relevant morbidities (using parental diaries and questionnaires).	2	All neonates admitted to the four level IV NICUs >24 weeks gestational age and BW >600g with a number of signs/symptoms of an underlying genetic disorder will be enrolled (e.g. hypotonia, poor feeding, hearing loss, etc).

The two methods are 1) Point of Care (POC) approach: a tablet-based screening for family/personal history of cancer will be offered to all patients aged 25-65 coming in for an appointment at the clinic.  2) Direct Patient Engagement (DPE):  Letters will be sent to all individuals aged 25-65 in a clinicʼs population, inviting them to visit a web site for screening for family/personal history of cancer.  In both groups, those determined to be high risk will then continue on with online education about genetic testing and an invitation to obtain such testing. This second step will be done on the web site.  Outcomes will be the fraction of the clinic population that participates in the family/personal screening and the fraction of the clinic population that undergoes genetic testing.	This grant proposes a randomized trial with a longitudinal follow up design for this mixed methods multilevel project to investigate the processes and structures used to implement cancer risk genomic testing into an existing healthcare system.  It will identify healthcare system based predictors of improvement in the system's adherence to guidelines, the patients' and providers' perceptions of risks and benefits of genetic information, effective methods to communicate these results to motivate action without unintended consequences (over-diagnosis, fatalistic responses, increased stigma), and best clinical flow for genomic screening procedures.

At this time, it is estimated that 12 sites will be recruited with the support of the University of Washington, ITHS Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho (WWAMI) region Practice and Research Network (WPRN). Per the National Cancer Institute, a single IRB will be required for this project, if funded.	Recruitment will be via point of care screening or letters or emails directly to the patient. Study procedures include electronic risk assessment (surveys), auto-taped interviews, genetic testing by saliva, online education.	Accrual period has not been established. Data collection will continue 24 months post-enrollment of the 510th participant.	This project will assess outcomes at three time points: baseline (before implementation) interim (6 months post implementation), follow-up (24 months post implementation).	None to report	Aim 1 Analyses:  The two primary outcomes are binary, i.e. whether or not each individual in the clinic population completed screening or genetic testing, and individuals are clustered within clinics.  Therefore the main analyses for this aim will be logistic regression using a mixed model that includes clinic as random effect, and intervention arm as a fixed effect.  Age and sex will also be included as person-level fixed effects. Quantitative Analyses will use quantitative scores at follow up from CFIR variables to conduct secondary analyses.  We will use simple descriptive statistics to compare overall means and standard deviations for all scale scores collected through quantitative surveys.  We will use analysis of variance with repeated measures to compare healthcare system differences. Qualitative Analysis will proceed through a series of well-used steps.  Interviews will be digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and reviewed by team members to establish familiarity with the data. An initial coding scheme will be developed based on the themes within our theoretical framework and the transcripts themselves. Additional codes will be added as needed. Two members of the research team will independently code each transcript. Coders will meet iteratively to establish inter-coder agreement. Coded data will be iteratively reviewed by the full investigative team in order to identify themes, as well as to select exemplary quotes [6,632].  Differences by participant race-ethnicity and provider and patient subgroup for each interview type will be explored\nAim 2 Analyses: We will take a systems approach to map out the clinical flow of the entire sequencing process to understand how patients move through the primary care and follow-up setting.  One important visualization tool is Value Stream Mapping (VSM), a type of flow chart that has been used in manufacturing settings to demonstrate the "lean" management concept [64]. VSM aims to identify waste and inefficiency in the system and provide optimum value to patients and healthcare providers through a value creation process. We will use VSM to identify the timing, duration and resource need at each step of the decision flow, which include scheduling of new tests, method selection, results interpretation, and information sharing with patients. Bottleneck, delays, non-value added time, and other barriers to implementation will be detected during the implementation process as areas of improvement. Another goal is to design standardized processes for incorporating genetic testing into the primary care setting for patients with different baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. A decision-analytic modeling approach will be taken to simulate the clinical flows on the population-aggregate level. This approach includes decision tree and Markov cohort simulation to project the effects of changes from before to after standardized sequencing processes. \nAim 3 Analyses: Analyses will consist of multiple regression to predict elements of clinical utility separately in patients and providers using baseline data and multiple predictors of interest.   Associated with Yij will be a vector xij of covariates for the patient (xij,patient), the provider (xij,provider),  time trends (xij,time), and the environment (xij,environment). We will model the probability of satisfaction, pr(Yij = 1) = E[Yij] = €ij, as a function of the covariates xij using regression as follows:  y(€ij) = xij,Tproviderα +  xij,Tpatientβ + xij,Ttime© + xij,Tenvironment™  Time covariates will be examined as two or four year intervals, as well as linear, quadratic or higher-order polynomials as statistically appropriate. These functions of time represent the diffusion curves. Patients within providers and regions are correlated with each other. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) [65] will take the correlation into account for the regression model. An exchangeable working correlation will be used along with the sandwich variance estimator to provide protection from misspecification of the correlation structure. General software for GEE is available in SAS PROC GENMOD.	If funded, the investigator is hoping to be ready in July 2019 to begin enrollment.

46	2016-12-03	7	\N	\N	Iron reduction therapy by blood donation for type 2 diabetes mellitus	Iron Study	2	Background: High levels of tissue iron, such as occur not only with hereditary or transfusional iron overload, but also with high levels of dietary intake, have been associated with diabetes risk and other aspects of metabolic syndrome including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Small trials of modest iron reduction by venesection in such individuals has shown to improve glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and markers of NASH. However, despite the safety and ease of this intervention and its potential benefit to blood banks, it has not been tested in larger and diverse populations and has therefore not been adapted clinically.    Trial design: We therefore propose a pragmatic clinical trial to take place in primary care clinics in the healthcare systems of Duke University, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and Wake Forest School of Medicine, all CTSA sites. Individuals with pre diabetes as defined by Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), or type 2 diabetes on non-hypoglycemic oral therapy will have serum ferritin determined, and those in the upper half of normal will be randomized, with half recommended to donate blood at either the blood banks of our Centers, the Red Cross, or our Clinical Research Units, until their ferritin levels are in the lowest quartile of normal. Inclusion criteria will be individuals with the above diagnoses, aged 40-75. Exclusion criteria will include anemia or history of recent blood loss, anticoagulant therapy, or serious intercurrent illness including current cancer diagnosis or therapy, serious chronic infections (hepatitis C, HIV), renal insufficiency (eGFR<60 ml/min), or history of orthostatic hypotension. Based on improvements observed in our and other preliminary trials, 60 subjects will be required in each group to detect a change in glycemic (fasting glucose or HbA1c). With determination of ferritin, baseline assessment will include fasting glucose and insulin and hemoglobin, and at or within 3 months of enrollment: HbA1c, serum creatinine, and serum aminotransferases. Serum ferritin will be reassessed 1-2 months after donation to determine the need for additional blood donation; typically 2-3 Units of blood will decrease serum ferritin from the starting upper half of normal to the target range. At each donation, hemoglobin will be assessed and phlebotomy halted if the subject is anemic. At each phlebotomy, blood pressure will be assessed before and after donation, and the subjects given a calorie-free rehydration drink to minimize the low risk of fainting with donation (<0.02% according to /red Cross statistics). Three months after attaining the ferritin goal, but not longer than 9 months after enrollment, fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and serum aminotransferases will be reassessed. Our primary endpoints will be improvements in fasting glycemia, HbA1c, and insulin sensitivity by the HOMA index. Secondary endpoints will be improvement in aminotrasferase levels or discontinuation of anti diabetic medications.	We are proposing a pragmatic clinical trial to determine the efficacy of implementing an iron reduction strategy in an outpatient clinical setting on indices of type 2 diabetes and NASH. A proposal to conduct a separate mechanistic trial with more intense documentation of glycemic status (frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testing) and NASH (MRI, Fibroscan and other serum markers) is under review at the NIH; that trial includes sham (blindfolded) phlebotomy. The proposed trial, in contrast, will involve little testing beyond what would be done in the course of normal clinical care, and only require fasting blood draws.    The steps in the trial will be:    Assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria by history and chart review.  Determination of serum ferritin, and if in the upper half of the normal range, additional blood work if necessary (fasting glucose and insulin, and if not determined with 3 months, HbA1c, hemoglobin and serum aminotransferase levels, and randomization to observation or phlebotomy.  Phlebotomy will be achieved at either the Red Cross, the Hospital blood banks at the participating centers, or their Clinical Research Units. 4-6 weeks after each phlebotomy, ferritin and the need for further phlebotomy will be reassessed if the target has not been achieved. Each phlebotomy will be of 1 Unit (500mL), with hemoglobin assessed before each procedure, and orthostatic hypotension assessed before and after. A calorie free rehydration drink will be offered each subject before the phlebotomy to minimize the low (<0.02%) risk of fainting.  Three months after attaining target ferritin, or within 9 months of enrollment, fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and serum aminotransferase levels will be reassessed. HbA1c will be used in the data analysis only if drawn at least 3 months after the most recent phlebotomy.	1. Determine the effects of iron reduction on glycemia in individuals with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or early T2DM. Adult subjects (N=180 total) aged 45-75 with pre- or early T2DM (diet controlled or nonhypogycemic oral agents) with ferritin values in the upper half of normal will be randomized either to observation or to donate blood in order to achieve ferritin levels in the lower quartile of normal. Glycemic control will be assessed by fasting glucose, homeostasis model of insulin resistance calculated from fasting glucose and insulin, and HbA1c before and after treatment. The primary outcomes will be assessed 3 months after achieving the target ferritin, and no longer than 9 months after initiating phlebotomy.     2. Determine the effect of phlebotomy on indices of NASH in these subjects. Serum transaminase levels will be assessed in subjects at enrollment and termination of the study.	The primary endpoint will be an improvement in glycemia (fasting blood glucose or HbA1c). We realize that fasting glucose is highly variable, and in a parallel mechanistic trial will hope to examine more complex and dynamic indices including oral and intravenous glucose tolerance testing, but as a pragmatic trial we are maintaining simplicity through the use of fasting glucose. We also realize that HbA1c will be affected by blood donation and therefore will use that value only if determined > 3 months after the most recent phlebotomy and have designed the trial to maximize this possibility. Our hypothesis is that blood donation will improve both of these indices as demonstrated in our pilot and other small clinical studies.    Secondary endpoints will include improvement in insulin sensitivity (decreased HOMA-IR), discontinuation of oral anti diabetic agents because of improved HbA1c, and improvement in serum aminotransferases. We are including the latter determinations because they are inexpensive and frequently assessed as part of usual clinical care, and because of the literature suggesting that they are also improved by phlebotomy. However, because we are not screening for NASH per se, which requires more expensive phenotyping, these are a secondary endpoint only.	1	Inclusion criteria will be ages 40-75, with a hemoglobin A1c values within three months or at enrollment of 5.7-6.5% (pre diabetes) or <9% with a diagnosis of diabetes. (That cut off will decrease the likelihood of major changes in intervention during the trial period). Subjects with diabetes will be taking non hypoglycemic oral agents (metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, acarbose, DPP4 inhibitors) only, and not insulin, sulfonylureas, or glinides.  Exclusion criteria will be: anemia or recent blood loss (GI bleed or major surgery within 12 months, sickle cell disease, blood donation within 6 months); bleeding diatheses (coagulation abnormalities or treatment with anticoagulants); serious chronic infections (hepatitis B or C, HIV) or chronic inflammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue diseases) that could elevate ferritin as an 'acute phase reactant'; active cancer diagnosis (excluding skin cell cancers other than melanoma); renal insufficiency (e GFR<60 ml/min); history of orthostatic hypotension.	This trial will be performed as a collaboration between three CTSA sites, UNC Chapel Hill, Wake Forest, and Duke. 3	The intervention is blood donation sufficient to reduce serum ferritin from the upper half of normal to the lower quartile of normal. In our pilot study, this was 2.5 � 0.5 Units.	Not provided	Not provided	None.	The primary outcomes will be assessed by comparing changes values at enrollment and end of the trial, between the phlebotomy and observation groups. Sample size was calculated from the effect size of donating a single unit of blood on fasting glucose and HbA1c in a European study, which is a likely underestimate of the effect size that we will observe in this trial with its greater degree of iron lowering and longer observation period. With a power of 0.80 we can detect an effect at p<0.05 with 59 subjects in each group. We are recruiting to allow a dropout rate of 33% and still achieve that power.    Secondary analysis will include assessing changes in the primary variable as a function of the degree of lowering of ferritin. Results will be stratified for weight, age, and gender as other variables that might affect response.	This trial will be performed as a collaboration between three CTSA sites, UNC Chapel Hill, Wake Forest, and Duke. The Directors of two of the CTSA programs (McClain, Wake Forest and Buse, UNC) and two of their Endocrinology Sections (Buse, UNC and D'alessia, Duke) at the three institutions are co-Investigators in this trial. Preliminary analysis at the Wake Forest clinics showed that by chart review there were 3,350 subjects fitting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and of those half will have ferretin levels in the upper half of normal. Recruitment will proceed with the assistance of the Recruitment Centers of each CTSA. This is a common disease and a safe and minimally disruptive intervention, so we do not anticipate problems with recruitment. Recruitment will occur over a period of six months, and procedures and data collection will be completed 9 months after that.

All participants will undergo a kidney biopsy to confirm amyloid deposition as a dominant contributor to their renal damage prior to being randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or NEOD001, a first humanized monoclonal antibody that aims to target and clear amyloid fibrils deposited in organs. The primary endpoint of RAIN is the achievement of a renal response.\nThe RAIN trial offers a unique opportunity to carry out novel histologic and molecular studies that will aid in our understanding of disease pathogenesis by using renal biopsy material. We believe that a novel histologic scoring system assessing individual baseline renal scarring and amyloid burden in addition to molecular transcriptional analsysis evaluating signatures of gene expression will clarify the complex mechanisms behind the development, progression and reversal of kidney damage. The histologic scores and molecular profiles will be compared between "renal responders" and "non-responders" in the study.  We hypothesize that both amyloid and intrinsic renal injury scores will be useful predictors of progression to end-stage renal disease and that recuperation of renal function will be inversely proportional to degree of baseline renal scarring. We also hypothesize that specific molecular signatures of gene expression isolated from podocytes will correspond to tissue alterations and regenerative pathways that will predict the likelihood of renal response or renal progression. We will also focus on short form 26 (SF-36) studies to evaluate patient-reported outcomes at specific time points throughout the study and we hypothesize that renal responses and renal progression on NEOD001 will translate into improved or worsened quality of life measures reported by patients	Proposed Study Design    This correlative study will be in conjunction with the RAIN trial, a multicenter, phase 2b, randomized, double-blind efficacy and safety study of NEOD001 versus placebo in adults with AL amyloidosis who have had a stable hematologic response to previous treatment but still exhibit renal dysfunction due to amyloidosis.  Tufts Medical Center will be the sponsoring site. NEOD001 or placebo will be administered once monthly for 12 months. We plan to enroll and randomize 100 subjects (1:1), 50 patients in each arm. All patients will complete SF-36 surveys at study entry, at 3,6,9, and 12 month visits and at early treatment discontinuation (ETD) or initial and confirmatory end of study (EOS) visits.    All enrolled patients will undergo screening renal biopsies (to confirm that amyloid is the dominant cause of the persistent renal dysfunction) upon study entry. All biopsies will undergo expert scoring of amyloid burden and pattern of infiltration using a new novel histologic scoring system. We will also  use portions of the renal biopsy for transcriptional profiling in collaboration with Dr. Matthias Kretzler and the NEPTUNE laboratory, experts in bioinformatics/molecular studies of glomerular pathologies.	Specific Aims:    1)     To determine the differences in patient-reported quality of life measures using SF-36 health surveys between responders and non-responders among patients with renal AL amyloidosis receiving NEOD001 therapy. If NEOD001 does reverse amyloid organ damage, then there should be evidence of symptomatic improvement among responders as captured by serial SF-36 health surveys.    2)     To establish whether differences in renal amyloid burden and the pattern of amyloid deposition from renal tissue samples at baseline influence response to NEOD001. Expert renal pathologists from each site will score the baseline biopsies using a validated scoring system in order to test this concept.    3)     To identify specific transcriptional signatures and regenerative gene expression pathways from pre-treatment renal samples that correlate with organ response and kidney function as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate. The transcriptional profiling and gene expression profiling will be in collaboration with the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) project.	Primary Endpoints:    1) Correlation between SF-36 scores and renal response\n2) correlation between signatures of gene expression and renal progression, renal recuperation and estimated glomerular filtration rate 3) correlate amyloid score and injury score to renal response, renal progression, and estimated glomerular filtration rate	1	Inclusion Criteria: \n1)18 years of age or older.\n2) Biopsy-proven diagnosis of AL amyloidosis by immunohistochemistry or mass spectroscopy of a tissue biopsy excluding bone marrow. \n3) Screening renal biopsy for RAIN confirming AL amyloidosis as exclusive or dominant cause of renal damage     .           4) Persistent renal involvement from diagnosis with proteinuria (predominantly albumin) > 500mg/day in a 24- hour urine collection\n5) CKD 1 to 3 (eGFR > 30)\n6)1 prior systemic hematologic therapy for a free light chain (FLC) producing hematologic malignancy underlying the initial diagnosis of AL amyloidosis with at least a partial FLC response (PR, VGPR, CR) to treatment deemed stable and not requiring further treatment\n7) ECOG Performance Status\n8) Clinical laboratory values:Absolute neutrophil count > 1000/?L, Platelet count > 75,000/?L ,Total bilirubin ? 1.5X ULN                       Alkaline phosphatase ? 5X ULN, NT-proBNP < 1800 pg/mL     \nExclusion Criteria : \n1) Amyloidosis due to mutations of the transthyretin gene or presence of other non-AL amyloidosis.\n2) Female patients who are lactating, breastfeeding, or pregnant.\n3) Patients with NT-proBNP ? 1800 pg/mL\n4) Patients who have not been treated or who have received chemotherapy within 6 months, or SCT within 12 months, for the light-chain producing hematologic disease causing AL amyloidosis, at the time of the first dose of NEOD001 (month 1 day 1)\n5) Patients who are CKD 4 or 5 or on dialysis (eGFR < 30)\n6) Patients who at initial diagnosis or later met the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) definition of active multiple myeloma (Appendix 3)\n7) Patients whose screening renal biopsies for RAIN show dominant causes of renal damage not related to AL amyloidosis     8) Medically documented cardiac syncope, uncompensatedcongestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant repetitive atrial or ventricular arrhythmias despite antiarrhythmic treatment, or severe orthostatic hypotension or clinically significant uncompensated autonomic insufficiency.    9) Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens.\n10) Ongoing or active infection, known HIV positive, known to be hepatitis B surface antigen-positive or has known or suspected active hepatitis C infection\n11) Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.	In total, 9 centers of excellence in AL amyloidosis across the US will participate in the parent trial.	All patients enrolled onto the RAIN trial will undergo screening kidney biopsies upon study entry prior to treatment. The kidney biopsy is to ensure that persistent renal dysfunction can be attributed to the presence of AL amyloidosis. All patients will also complete SF-36 health surveys upon study entry, at 3,6,9, and 12 -month visits and at early treatment discontinuation (ETD) or initial and confirmatory end of study (EOS) visits.	36 months	12 months	\N	\N	Not provided
375	2018-08-29	5	\N	t	Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network	PrecISE	2	The PrecISE Network will undertake an Adaptive Platform Trial conducted under a single Master Protocol to identify new therapies for severe asthma that are effective in biomarker-defined phenotypic subgroups of patients. The trial is designed to meet our primary objectives, namely, to:  (1) Identify novel therapies that work in biomarker-defined subgroups of severe asthmatic patients, and (2) optimize the subgroups targeted for treatment by refining the biomarkers and subgroup definitions. \n\nThe study will take a personalized medicine approach to optimize the subgroup of patients targeted by each therapy, adapting treatment assignment probabilities as the subgroup definitions change based on accumulating data.  Up to six novel therapies will be investigated.	Common platforms for biomarker screening will be used to determine a patient's biomarker profile during the initial screening period.  Treatments will be randomly assigned based on biomarker profiles, and at each point in the study, patients will have a higher likelihood of assignment to a therapy that targets their particular profile.  \n\nA double-blind cross-over trial design will be used, consisting of 3-month treatment periods followed by 2-month wash-out periods between treatments.  Patients will be re-randomized at the end of each wash-out period.  Therapies may enter the study at different times, depending on availability, and may be discontinued, based on interim analyses conducted for futility.  Each patient will receive a minimum of 3 test treatments and a maximum of 6, depending on their time of enrollment, and will receive placebo at least once, but no more than twice.  \n\nThe mode of placebo administration will be randomly assigned for a subset of patients, and masking of treatment assignments will be maintained by matching a patient's placebo to one of the test treatments received.   Placebo data will be shared across test treatments for comparative analyses, but test treatments will not be compared to each other with respect to effectiveness or safety.	Primary Objectives:  (1) Identify novel therapies that work in biomarker-defined subgroups of severe asthmatic patients; (2) Optimize the subgroups targeted for treatment by refining the biomarkers and subgroup definitions.\n\nSecondary Objectives: (1) Gain information about potential monitoring biomarkers for selected therapies (2) Investigate the safety and effectiveness of selected therapies in pediatric asthmatic patients;.	There will be 3 co-primary efficacy endpoints:\n(1)\tFEV1 percent predicted, described in terms of change from baseline but analyzed controlling for baseline and important biomarkers (e.g., blood eosinophils and serum IL-6 levels, as continuous covariates)\n(2)\tAsthma symptoms assessed via ACQ; score analyzed as above\n(3)\tUncontrolled asthma days assessed via CompEx over 3 months of treatment	3	Baseline Therapy (2 month):\n• High Dose ICS:  [highest marketed dose of ICS available in the US] + an additional asthma controller  (e.g., LABA, LAMA, LTRA) AND/OR \n• Systemic CS (minimal dose of 10mg) ≥ 50% of the prior year for asthma AND/OR \n• A biologic for asthma.\n\nBaseline Asthma Control:\n• FEV1 <80% predicted (adults) or FEV1<90% (peds) after BD hold OR \n• Poor symptom control - ACT ≤19 OR\n• ≥ 2 bursts of systemic CS (>3 days for adults and adolescents, >1 day for adolescents treated with dexamethasone) in prior year and/or one or more severe exacerbations resulting in hospitalization in the prior year.  Any intramuscular or intravenous treatment with systemic corticosteroids above the maintenance dose regardless of the number of days of treatment.\n\nAdditional Criteria:\n• BD reversibility ≥12% FEV1 increase after 4 puffs of albuterol and/or\n• Positive methacholine PC20 <16mg/ml and/or\n• Historical evidence of either criterion if testing was performed at the recruitment center within the past year.	There will be 29 US sites and 2 international sites (UK and Canada). \n*11 sites are CTSA hub institutions and an additional 12 sites are affiliates of those 12 CTSA hubs. On the next page, we indicate 11 CTSA hubs, but in total, 23 of the 31 sites are primary or affiliate CTSA institutions.	Up to 6 novel interventions for severe asthma will be studied, each targeting a specific, biomarker-defined phenotypic subgroup of patients.  Candidates include novel medications not yet FDA approved, FDA approved medications not currently indicated for severe asthma, and dietary supplements that target mechanisms relevant to asthma pathology. \n\nStudy treatments include: Imatinib, Anti-IL6, Cavosonstat, Broncho-Vaxom, Jak inhibitor, T2 with Imaging (Dupilumab)\nVitaflo	Approximately 50 months	Based on a 42-month study period and projected recruitment of 40 patients per month, a 3-month ramp-up for recruitment, and a 2-month run-in period, all patients completing the study will receive at least 3 treatments and placebo, with a maximum number of 6 treatments and placebo.  At the start of the first treatment period, patients will enter a 4-6 week screening period, complete baseline assessments, be randomized, and receive treatment for 3 months, followed by a 2-month wash-out period with no treatment.  With our projected accrual rate, 80 patients will have study duration of 20 months (4 treatment periods), 267 will have 25 months, 2676 will have 30 months, and 186 will have 35 ½ months.	\N	The overall trial will recruit 800 participants with severe asthma over 18 months. In our proposed central trial design, the participants will be initially stratified into three subpopulations based upon phenotype/endotype and randomized, within each subpopulation, to two active interventions or a standard of care arm. If operationally feasible across treatments, we recommend a double-blind design. Interim analyses will be performed at 12 and 18 months after the start of the trial, and at trial completion. If enrollment is slower than projected, we will add an interim analysis at 24 months. At the first interim analysis we will have outcome data on enough to compare standard of care and active interventions. Due to staggered entry, we expect about 300 participants to have between 24 and 48 weeks of follow-up at the time of the first interim analysis (see power analyses below). Data will be analyzed within each phenotype/endotype. Each interim analysis will have the following objectives: 1) determine whether the length of follow-up can be shortened from 48 to 24 weeks; 2) terminate an intervention for futility or efficacy, with replacement of the interventions terminated for futility with new active interventions; and 3) identify a subgroup of participants within a given phenotype/endotype with good response to an active intervention to continue enrolling in that intervention until more data are available. We will test at least three interventions including one which is not FDA approved. One advantage of our proposed sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trial is that adding new, promising interventions during the trial protocol is possible and much more efficient than initiating new, independent protocols. Due to the sizable placebo response observed in some severe asthma trials,17 newly enrolled participants can be randomized to the standard of care arm as well as intervention arms. If there are two active interventions in a given phenotype/endotype, the randomization ratio will be 1:1:1. We expect to accumulate enough outcome data for each phenotype/endotype on the standard of care arm during the first 2/3 of the trial that participants are re-randomized to only active interventions, not standard of care.\nParticipants who failed an active intervention will not be switched to the standard of care, but will be re- randomized to one of the active arms still in the running for that patient's phenotype/endotype. We will consider the patient to have failed an intervention if the patient experiences asthma exacerbations or the patterns of monitoring markers indicate the probability of an exacerbation of higher than 95% according to our model relating exacerbations and monitoring biomarkers. Participants assigned to the standard of care arm will be re- randomized after they failed or they completed the follow-up (required follow-up length is 24 or 48 weeks as established during interim analyses). Each patient will potentially receive two different interventions during the course of the trial.\nPower analyses: To stop an active intervention for efficacy or futility, based on the comparison with the standard of care arm, we will use triangular test boundaries. Let Zk be the test statistics comparing an active intervention and standard of care arm at the time of the kth interim analysis, k = 1, 2 and 3. An intervention will be stopped for efficacy if Zk > uk with (u1, u2, u3) = (2.85, 2.02, 1.65); an intervention will be stopped for futility if Zk < lk with (l1, l2, l3) = (0.93, 1.43, 1.65). For example, if an active intervention is no better than the standard of care, the probability of stopping that intervention for futility at the first interim analysis is 0.79. With 90 participants in the standard of care arm and 90 participants in an intervention arm, the sequential design with triangular boundaries described above will have 84% power to show that the therapy is effective based on one- sided test of size 0.05 if the effect size is equal to 0.50. The sequential boundaries (u1, u2, u3) and (l1, l2, l3) given above are for two interim and the final analysis performed at equal statistical information increments.\nDue to staggered entry we might need to re-compute the values u1, u2, u3, l1, l2, and l3 for a given active intervention at the time of the interim analysis as these values depend on the number of participants and the cumulative follow-up time on that active arm and on the standard of care arm. If we identify at least two successful interventions for a given phenotype/endotype, we will use Q-learning19 to perform a post-hoc analysis to determine the best initial treatment, and the best next treatment if the initial treatment does not work out, for each participant. The sample size in the trial (n = 800) is sufficient for Q-learning to identify the optimal treatment sequence with up to 12 distinct treatment sequences.	\N
420	2018-10-23	55	\N	t	CardioVascular PROTECTion in at Risk Anthracycline-Treated Breast and Lymphoma Patients Randomized to Combination Carvedilol and Lisinopril versus Placebo (CV-PROTECT)	CV-Protect	4	Our goal is to determine whether combination lisinopril and carvedilol prevents heart failure (HF) and significant reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with evidence of early cardiotoxicity in the setting of anthracycline-based chemotherapy.  Patients with breast cancer or lymphoma treated with anthracycline based chemotherapy will be monitored with protocol-defined echocardiographic and biomarker assessments.  Patients who develop an elevated post-infusion troponin level (Tn) or an abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) will be randomized to open label lisinopril and carvedilol or usual care. We will determine whether combination neurohormonal antagonist therapy prevents the development of CV death, symptomatic HF, cancer therapy modification due to cardiotoxicity, or reduced LVEF. \nOur study tests, for the first time, a strategy of combined biomarker and echocardiographic surveillance to target neurohormonal blockade and will impact the care of breast cancer and lymphoma patients receiving anthracyclines.	We will seek to enroll all patients newly diagnosed with Breast Cancer or Lymphoma in the Anthracycline Treatment Registry. At the time of enrollment, the consent language will describe the nested RCT should one of the protocol defined clinical assessments indicate cardiotoxicity.	The objective of this study is two-fold. First, to test the sensitivity and specificity of a combined biomarker and imaging screening strategy to detect subclinical cardiotoxicity in a representative multi-center cohort with core lab imaging assessment and blinded outcome adjudication.  We anticipate that the prospective collection of data including known variables associated with cardiotoxicity (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation) will subsequently allow for the development of refined prediction tools capable of educating patients and providers with the anticipated risk of cardiotoxicity.  Second, we will conduct a reactive prevention trial of combination carvedilol and lisinopril in patients at greatest risk of cardiotoxicity to test their efficacy in prevention of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, symptomatic HF and cancer therapy modifications due to cardiotoxicity. Irrespective of whether a positive or negative result is obtained we anticipate that completion of this study will influence the care of cancer patients receiving anthracycline treatment.	CV Death: Death due to cardiovascular causes or sudden death without another cause.  All deaths will be adjudicated by a blinded adjudication committee.  \n\nClinical diagnosis of Heart Failure (HF): Clinical HF will be diagnosed by an advanced HF transplantation board certified/eligible cardiologist and will be reviewed by an adjudication committee. Examples of HF diagnoses include NYHA Class II-IV dyspnea, hospitalization for decompensated HF, treatment for HF with a loop diuretic, radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema and a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure > 15 mmHg or LVEDP > 18 mmHg at cardiac catheterization.\n\nChemotherapy dose modification because of practitioner perceived cardiotoxicity: The reason for chemotherapy dose modification will be tracked using a questionnaire. This endpoint will be achieved should a practitioner or oncology team report that the dose and/or timing of chemotherapy was modified for what was perceived to be cardiotoxicity.\n\nDecline in LVEF: A reduction in LVEF of 10% or greater to a level that is also less than an LVEF of 50% will be a primary outcome for this study.	1	RCT: Inclusion Criteria\n1.\tGlobal Longitudinal Strain < -19% or a decrement in GLS of greater than or equal to 15% from baseline\nOR\n2.\tTroponin I, Troponin T or High sensitivity troponin I value ≥99% of the reference population measured by local laboratory collected each cycle of chemotherapy\nRCT: Exclusion Criteria\n1.\tLVEF <50% \n2.\tCurrent therapy with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers for hypertension\n3.\tDiagnosis of heart failure\n4.\tGFR < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 within 90 days prior to randomization\n5.\tSerum potassium > 5.1mEq/L\n6.\tSystolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg or <90mmHg or Diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg seated\n7.\tAllergy or contraindication to beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers\n8.\tDocumentation of LVEF < 45% at any time prior to enrollment\n9.\tPrimary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Infiltrative cardiomyopathy (amyloid), Constrictive pericarditis or tamponade, Complex congenital heart disease\n10.\tMore than moderate aortic or mitral stenosis\n11.\tIntrinsic (prolapse, rheumatic) valve disease with severe mitral, tricuspid or aortic regurgitation	Heart Failure Network Sites, ALLIANCE oncology cooperative and ECOG sites	Study Intervention: Placebo or carvedilol (initial dose 3.125 bid) and lisinopril (initial dose 5mg daily) with uptitration as tolerated to target doses of carvedilol 25mg bid and lisinopril 40mg daily. Study drug will be titrated every 2-4 weeks until target dose or maximally tolerated dose achieved.  The goal is to achieve a blood pressure level of SBP 100-120, DBP 60-80 and heart rate 60-80. Significant bradycardia will result in the escalation only of the Lisinopril/placebo while hyperkalemia/renal insufficiency will result in dose escalation only of carvedilol/placebo.  If cough develops on lisinopril then losartan versus placebo will be substituted at a starting dose of 25mg with uptitration as tolerated to 150mg daily.	5 years. We anticipate 2 years for enrollment and 3 years of follow-up	3 years	\N	The primary analysis will be an intention to treat, time to event analysis of the association between randomization to carvedilol and lisinopril and the primary composite outcome of CV death, symptomatic HF, cancer therapy modification for cardiotoxicity and reductions in LVEF of ≥10% to <50% accounting for the competing risk of non-CV death.  Secondary analyses will include an ITT comparison between treatment arms in the time to the components of the primary outcome individually (CV death, clinical HF diagnosis, modification of cancer therapy due to cardiotoxicity and LVEF reduction of ≥10% to <50% as well as addition key secondary outcomes of all cause death, cancer death, CV hospitalizations, and invasive disease free survival.  We will also compare LVIDD, LVEF, NTproBNP, PROMIS, MLHFQ and 6 minute walk test distance between treatment and control groups measured at 6 months and 3 years.  Important safety analyses will include the cumulative incidence of acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia and symptomatic hypotension as well as the oncologic outcomes above.	We will establish a registry of 2,800-3,000 patients who will receive anthracycline-based chemotherapy for breast cancer or lymphoma and follow each patient through cancer treatment with protocol-defined echocardiographic and biomarker assessments. Echocardiography and troponin markers of pre-clinical cardiotoxicity will be measured as defined by protocol during chemotherapy. We will then prospectively identify patients who show early cardiotoxicity who will then be eligible for enrollment in the randomized controlled trial.
456	2019-01-16	20	\N	t	Lipoic acid for the treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis	LA in PMS	2	Purpose of this multi-site randomized, placebo-controlled trial is to determine if the supplement, lipoic acid (LA), can slow disability progression, reduce brain atrophy, and is safe and tolerated in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis\n(PMS). The 118 participants will be enrolled over an 18 month period at 7 study sites. There are 7 study visits over the course of the 2 year trial. Study sites include Veterans administration sites covered by a VA central IRB and non VA sites covered by the IRB at Utah. 9 sites in total.	This is a phase 2, double-blind, multi-center randomized controlled trial to compare the daily administration of 1200 mg oral LA to a placebo, as a disease-modifying treatment in PMS. A total of 118 subjects with PMS will be randomized 1:1 to LA or placebo. None of the study procedures involve usual care.	The primary objective is to determine if LA is superior to placebo in reducing the clinical decline (progression) in people with PMS. This will be measured as the ability of LA over placebo in maintaining mobility as measured by the primary\noutcome of change in completion time of the Timed 25 Foot Walk. Secondary mobility outcomes are changes in the 2 Minute Timed Walk and fall counts for consistency of the effects of LA on mobility. Additional clinical secondary outcome measures are changes in neurological disability, cognition, mood, and quality of life. The secondary objective is to determine if LA is superior to placebo in slowing whole brain atrophy, the gold-standard MRI surrogate outcome measure in PMS trials, with an estimated 40-50%% effect size. Additional MRI secondary outcome measures are white and grey matter atrophy, T2 lesion volume, and brain segmentation volumes. The third objective is to monitor the safety and tolerability of LA via laboratory testing and adverse event reporting.	The primary outcome measure is change in completion time of the Timed 25 Foot Walk. Secondary mobility outcomes are changes in the 2 Minute Timed Walk and fall counts for consistency of the effects of LA on mobility. Additional clinical\nsecondary outcome measures are changes in neurological disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS), tests of manual dexterity (9 Hole Peg Test) and cognition (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, California Verbal Learning Test- Second\nEdition, and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test- Revised). Questionnaires using the Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information Systems (PROMIS) will be used to assess pain intensity, pain interference, and ability to participate in social roles. Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), sleep (Last Night Sleep Quality and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Assessment), and fatigue (Modified Fatigue impact Scale) will also be captured. Tertiary outcomes of safety and tolerability will utilize safety laboratory tests at 6 of the 7 visits, adverse event reporting, and development of suicidality (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale).	1	Inclusion criteria:\ni.\tAge > 18 years.\nii.\tPrevious diagnosis of RRMS or PPMS by 2010 revised McDonald criteria.(20)\niii.\tCurrent SPMS or PPMS.\niv.\tProgression of MS in the previous 2 years defined by medical record or reliable historical interview as:\na.\tNon relapse-related MS decline resulting in a 0.5 step change in EDSS, decline in T25FW, or other clinically documented decline (can be assigned retrospectively) if not on a DMT, OR\nb.\tIf currently on a DMT, non-relapse-related MS decline resulting in a 0.5 step change in EDSS, decline in T25FW, or other clinically documented decline (can be assigned retrospectively) while on the current DMT taken continuously for at least 1 year prior to enrolment.\nv.\tAble to give informed consent and to adhere to study procedures.\nvi.\tEDSS 3.0 to 6.5.\nExclusion criteria: \ni.\tA self-reported medical or neurological problem other than MS that is a cause of progressive or fluctuating gait dysfunction (e.g. worsening neuropathy, uncontrolled lower extremity arthritis, uncontrolled cardiopulmonary disease).

Study timeline and visit scheduling. The anticipated study recruitment period is for the first 18 months once the study is approved at the first study site or until enrollment is completed, whichever occurs first. The study will end when the last\nparticipant exits the study. There will be no more than 60 days inclusive between the screen and baseline visits. Thereafter study visits will occur +/- 2 weeks from the ideal visit based on the month (M) zero visit. Participants remain in the study\nfor 2 years, and data analysis is planned for 6 months after the final subject exits for a total of 48 months once enrollment begins.	Participants remain in the study for 2 years. Adverse events or other reasons may require an unscheduled visit 3 months after the final study visit.	There are no financial ties or other conflicts of interest by any study team member or study team organizations related to this study.	We will use the mixed model approach to compare, between the treatment groups, mean rates of change from baseline in the times to complete the T25FW. We will use the transformation 25/T25FW, which is the walking speed in feet per second. In constructing these models for the T25FW walking speed outcome, we will incorporate as a predictor the factor used for randomization, baseline disability. We are primarily interested in whether there is a difference between the treatment groups in the T25FW rate changes. Given evidence of interaction, comparisons of both 12 and 24 month change between the treatment groups will be made, using a Bonferroni multiple comparison adjustment for two time points of interest. Additional models will include as covariates, baseline measures of disease duration and use of MS medications if significantly related to the response when added to the original model or result in a 10% change or greater in the estimated overall treatment effect. Secondarily, we will compare with a t-test or nonparametric tests the proportion of participants who demonstrate clinically significant worsening in gait defined by a 20% improvement in the T25FW and/or 2MTW and/or requires greater assistance to walk (e.g. newly require a cane, transition from cane to walker, etc.). We will do sensitivity analyses using an intention to treat analysis with the cross-over with and without participants who have a change in their disease-modifying therapy during the course of the study. We will add compliance information as determined by pill-counts to the mixed model. The impact of LA on falls frequency will be assessed by comparing changes in fall frequency from the first to the last 3 months. A principal intention-to-treat analysis using linear Poisson mixed models to evaluate the association between time period, fall frequency, and group allocation will test the hypothesis that fall frequency is reduced more by LA than placebo. Mixed models will be used to correct for autocorrelation of within-subject repeated measures and allow for missing data, and include covariates associated with falling such as age, level of disability, and use of a walking aid. As exploratory secondary outcome measure, we will investigate the disconjugate composite endpoint based on sustained change in EDSS, clinically significant worsening in gait as defined above, or 20% increase in 9HPT. The mixed model approach will compare the mean rates of change from baseline in brain as measured by SIENA. Age, sex, and disease duration will be used as covariates along with disability as determined by the randomization method. We will tabulate all adverse and serious adverse events and compare the differences in the occurrence and the frequencies between the two groups. The frequency of side effects will be compared using χ2 tests or Fisher's exact test as appropriate depending on the number of adverse events seen. For evaluation of patient safety, laboratory test results at baseline and changes from baseline will be summarized and compared using t-tests for continuous measures and Fisher's exact test for proportions	The anticipated study recruitment period is for the first 18 months once the study is approved at the first study site or until enrollment is completed, whichever occurs first. The study will end when the last participant exits the study. There will be no more than 60 days inclusive between the screen and baseline visits. Thereafter study visits will occur +/- 2 weeks from the ideal visit based on the month (M) zero visit. Estimation is that it will take 6 months for all the sites to have gained IRB\napproval and start recruiting. Recruitment is likely to be equal between sites (approximately 10-15 per site) with the exception of the principal site, the VA Portland Health Care System, which is the site of the PI and is likely to recruit\n15-25 due to local enthusiasm for the study. The enrollment period of 18 months means that sites will need to recruit less\nthan subject per month or less. This is in line with the recruitment rate of a pilot study of LA in a progressive population at the Portland site.\n\nThis study has been open to enrollment at the primary site for approximately 7 months and has proven to be difficult. Efforts have been primarily concentrated on identifying subjects through physician clinics. We have also partnered with the MS society and they have sent the opportunity out via email to members who receive communications from them. To date the 6 sites that have been initiated have consented 18 subjects. Initial impressions are that the inclusion criteria are hard to meet. We would welcome any help you can offer related to the recruitment plan and site specific efforts.
175	2017-07-18	70	\N	\N	OPTIMUM: Optimizing Outcomes of Treatment- Resistant Depression in Older Adults\nStudy Protocol	The OPTIMUM Study	5	Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major health problem for the growing population of older adults. One-half or more of older adults fail to remit with antidepressant pharmacotherapy. TRD in older adults is highly deleterious, because persistence of depression is a leading cause of disability, suicide, dementia, and premature mortality.\nMaking it worse is a lack of evidence-based treatments, at a stage of life when understanding the benefits vs. risk of\nmedication is crucial. OPTIMUM will provide evidence that stakeholders need to offer older adults the optimal\ntreatment they deserve.\n\nThe Optimizing Outcomes of Treatment-Resistant Depression in Older Adults (OPTIMUM) study will provide the evidence that older adults need to get effective treatment that works best for them, improving their quality of life while minimizing risks of medications.\n\nThe study is currently funded by PCORI (13.5 million dollars over 5 years) and will also receive additional funding of 10 million dollars over 5 years from the NIMH. This award is expected in September 2017.	OPTIMUM is a Phase 4 study which will assess which antidepressants work best in older adults. The study design compares benefits and risks of 3 first-line (simpler to use) strategies: augmentation with aripiprazole, augmentation with bupropion, and switch to bupropion; and 2 second-line (requires more monitoring) strategies: augmentation with lithium and switch to nortriptyline. The step-wise design matches real-world care, in which clinicians go from easier to more challenging management strategies.  \n\nSubjects will be randomized to one of three Step1 strategies:\n\n1) Adding aripiprazole to current antidepressant medication\n2) Adding bupropion to current antidepressant medication\n3) Replacing current antidepressant medication with bupropion\nIf at the end of 10 weeks depression has been relieved, participants will proceed to Continuation Phase of the study follow-up and assessments will be performed at 4, 8, and 12 months.\n\nIf depression is not relieved, participants will proceed to Step 2. \nParticipants who do not qualify for Step 1 may enter directly into Step 2.\n\nDuring Step 2, participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 medication strategies:\n1) Adding lithium to current antidepressant medication\n2) Replacing current antidepressant medication with nortriptyline\n\nParticipants will proceed to Continuation Phase of the study (as described above).\nAssessments include questions about medical history, medications, physical functioning, mood & emotions, tests to\nassess thinking, attention, memory, dexterity, grip strength, standing balance, gait speed, saliva DNA collection,\nblood draws, and review of adverse events.\n\nThose who complete acute treatment and remit will be followed for 1 year.\n\nRandomization of participants will be implemented in REDCap, using a randomized block design within clinic and age group using variable block size, stratified by institutional site and age strata.\n\nOnly assessors of outcome measures will be blinded. Participants, providers, and other research staff will not be blinded to participants' condition.	The study aims to close the evidence gap on late-life depression in three ways:\nAim 1: Effectiveness\n-  We will examine the comparative benefits and risks of antidepressant strategies (augmentation and switching) in older adults with TRD. \n\n- Effectiveness outcomes: psychological well-being and remission from depression\n- Safety outcomes: serious adverse events, falls, and fall-related injuries\n\nAim 2: Effects of Aging\n- We will explore how age, and age-related variables (medical comorbidity, cognitive problems) change the balance of benefits vs. risks. \n\nAim 3: Maximize Stakeholder Engagement\n- We will maximize stakeholder engagement to ensure relevancy to providers and patients alike.	Psychological well-being is the patient-centered effectiveness outcome and remission from depression is the clinician-focused effectiveness outcome. Secondary patient-reported outcomes include physical function and social participation. Safety will be monitored through serious adverse events as well as falls and fall-related injuries. As well, the study will test how aging influences the relative benefits and risks of antidepressants for TRD.  Additionally, a qualitative study of patient and clinician partners will provide the lived experience of TRD and antidepressant strategies.	1	All participants will meet the following eligibility criteria: \nInclusion Criteria:\na) Men and women aged 60 and older, with equal proportions aged 60-70 and 70+\nb) Current Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), single or recurrent, as diagnosed by DSM-5 criteria\nc) Failure to respond adequately to two or more antidepressant treatment trials of recommended dose and length (approximately 12 weeks)\nd) PHQ-9 score of 6 or higher\n\nExclusion Criteria: \na) Inability to provide informed consent\nb) Dementia, as defined by Short Blessed ≥10 and/or clinical evidence of dementia. Patients screened out due to possible dementia will be referred to a local Memory Clinic or back to their clinician for evaluation to clarify the presence or absence of dementia\nc) Lifetime diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or current psychotic symptoms. A recommendation for psychiatric referral will be made in these cases.\nd) High risk for suicide (e.g. active SI and or current/recent intent or plan) and unable to be managed safely in the clinical trial, such as unwilling to be hospitalized). Urgent psychiatric referral will be made in these cases.\ne) Contraindication to proposed study medications, as determined by study physician including history of intolerance or non-response to proposed medications.\nf) Non-correctable, clinically significant sensory impairment (e.g., cannot hear well enough to cooperate with interview).\ng) Unstable medical illness, including delirium, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or cerebrovascular or cardiovascular risk factors that are not under medical management. This will be determined based on information from the patient's personal physician's and study physician clinical judgement. Referral to the patient's personal physician or to a general practitioner will be made in these cases.\nh) Moderate to severe substance or alcohol use disorder, as determined by study physician. Referral to appropriate treatment will be made in these cases. \ni) Seizure disorder.\nj) Parkinson's Disease\nNo exclusion criteria are based on race, ethnicity, or gender.\n\nExclusions to Enter Step 2: \nThe following conditions are contraindications to Step 2 medications. Participants with them will not be eligible for Step 2 participation: \na)\tQTc prolongation or Wide QRS on EKG\nb)\tIschemic Heart Disease (e.g., prior MI, stent, or bypass)\nc)\tAcute or chronic renal insufficiency \nd)\tNarrow angle glaucoma	We will recruit across five regions: St. Louis and rural Missouri; Los Angeles City and County; Western Pennsylvania; New York City; and outside of the United States in Toronto and rural Ontario. Two-thirds of the sample will be women and 70% white, 15% black, 10% Latino, and 5% other racial groups.\n\nPatients will be identified from clinical networks at each of the five participating centers. Our two primary mechanisms of recruitment will be through screening and referrals. We will screen through clinical networks using Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and will contact all patients in practices aged 60 and older who in the recent past were prescribed or are currently taking antidepressants. Referrals will be elicited from practitioners and through in-practice advertisements to patients and their caregivers specifically asking if the doctor, patient, or caregiver describes the clinical situation as treatment resistant or difficult to treat.	In the OPTIMUM Study, subjects will be randomized to one of three Step 1 strategies:\n1) Augmentation with aripiprazole - starting at 2 mg po daily; increase every two weeks (i.e., to 5, 7, 10 mg) to a maximum of 15 mg po daily, based on response and tolerability).\n2) Augmentation with bupropion - once daily extended release, starting at 150 mg po daily; titrated after four weeks to 300 mg po daily (based on response and tolerability).\n3) Switch to bupropion - same parameters as with bupropion augmentation\nThose who do not attain remission in Step 1\nwill be randomized to one of two Step 2 strategies:\n1) Augmentation with lithium - starting at 300 mg po daily, titrated per blood level to 0.4-0.6 meQ/L\n 2) Switch to nortriptyline - starting at 25 mg po daily, titrated per blood level to 80-120 ng/ml.	The study opened to enrollment in February 2017\nThe anticipated date of completion including data analysis is September 2021.	It will take up to 18 months for each individual participant to complete all visits.	The research team members have no financial ties or other financial conflicts of interest related to this study.	A priori, specific plans for data analysis correspond to major aims and will be directed by Co-I J. Philip Miller, professor of biostatistics at the coordinating site. \nWe will follow the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. In other words, patients who receive co-prescribed medications stop randomized medication, or switch to a different medication will continue to be followed.  To confirm that ITT findings represent the "true" data on effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of management strategies, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis that will compare ITT to per-protocol findings. \n\nH1a (Psychological Well-Being): We will use a repeated measures 2*2*3 ANOVA with age (60-70, >70), time (baseline, end of Active phase of Step 1) by treatment group (3 levels). Specific time* treatment group contrasts will compare the changes across pairs of treatment groups. These tests will be conducted with a significance level of .05/3. We will include site as a strata in all analyses.63 For those who proceed to Step 2, analogous repeated measures 2*2*2 ANOVA will be used with a significance level of .05 for the time*treatment group comparison. \n\nH1b (remission): Corresponding 2*3 (age by treatment group) generalized linear models with a logit link function will be computed for the dichotomous outcome of remission. \n\nIn the continuation phase we will explore the long-term effectiveness of antidepressants:\nWe will test for preservation of psychological well-being and other quality of life variables, and sustained resolution of depressive symptoms, by mixed effects repeated measures models.\n\nWe will also test for sustained remission by measuring relapse in each arm. Relapse will be defined as meeting DSM 5 criteria for a major depressive episode, as determined by an Independent Evaluator who will confirm the diagnosis by conferring with a study investigator.  We will carry out Cox models examining time to relapse and time to dropout, to examine for treatment inferiority (i.e., whether one antidepressant strategy produces poorer long-term outcomes).  Based on our prior research we don't have an empirical basis to posit a specific arm as inferior.   Therefore, although these analyses are important to our stakeholders, we describe them as exploratory.\n\nWe will also examine exploratory hypotheses, such as whether there are baseline covariates which will help to significantly enhance the prediction of response to treatments, e.g., gender, race, treatment site (primary care vs. specialty clinic), social support, co-treatments. This will enhance the precision medicine implications of the study.\n\nH2: serious adverse events, falls, and fall-related injuries are the safety outcomes. Cox models examining time to event (with Anderson & Gill64 extensions for repeated events) will compare the treatment arms during both the acute phase and the continuation in terms of serious adverse events, falls, and fall-related injuries.\nWe will also compute rates of side effects in each arm, as specifically recommended by patient stakeholders.  These data are not hypothesis-testing, but they support the patient-centered goal of allowing clinicians and patients to know what to expect in terms of side effects from treatment. \nH3: Moderator analyses (Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects).\nConfirmatory analysis (HT-1): Effectiveness and safety differences between treatment arms will be moderated by age. Specifically, with increasing age effectiveness differences between treatment arms will decrease, and safety differences between treatment arms will increase.\n\nRationale: Our stakeholders demand that we move past the current "one size fits all" paradigm of antidepressant prescribing.  Precision treatment would greatly improve older adults' quality of life.\n\nData analysis plan for moderator testing:  We will include the treatment by age group (<70 vs >70) by time interaction to the linear models described above to test for both the benefits and risks for the treatment alternatives. \n\nWe are well-powered for a confirmatory moderator analysis examining how age modulates the differences between treatment arms in comparative benefits and risks, because of our recruitment strategy aiming for equally-sized strata of ages (60-70 and >70).  Age will be treated as a categorical variable, comparing relative benefits and risks of antidepressants in those aged <70 to those aged >70.  \n\nHere are some scenarios of the types of treatment modulators by age that we will be able to detect with a power > 85% (using SAS's GLMPOWER): (1) If treatment arm A has superior effectiveness over arm B by 2.3 points more than what would be predicted based on age and treatment effects on Psychological Well-being for age 60-70 but no difference between arms for age >70; (2) If treatment arm A has a superior effectiveness over arm B in terms of 13% higher remission rate for age 60-70, but there is no difference between arms for age>70.  \nExploratory moderator analyses based on aging-related brain and systemic health variables: Our next step will be to analyze three aging-related variables -impairment in executive cognitive function, frailty, and medical complexity -   treated both as continuous variables and categorical variables, using the same models as with chronological age.\n\nFinally, we will examine the relative strength of these moderator variables by performing a combined moderator test. This exploratory analysis incorporates all of the age-related variables into models of each effectiveness and safety finding from hypothesis-testing.  \n\nNotes regarding these Heterogeneity of Treatment Effect (moderator) analyses: We will perform statistical contrasts between treatment arms as a function of thee pre-specified moderator variables, and we will report all of these prespecified analyses, as well as post-hoc analyses, in published reports.	The first patient was enrolled at Washington  University (WU) in February 2017; 15 participants have been enrolled to date. The total enrollment from all 5 sites is 57. \nThe recruitment rate at WU is 3.75 per month, but the goal is to enroll 8-9 participants per month.\nThe overall recruitment rate is 14.25 per month, but the goal is 42 participants per month across all sites). It should be noted that actual start dates vary by site, so this average monthly enrollment is not representative of all sites. \n\nBecause this study depends on recruiting a very large number of patients found in primary care and specialty mental heatlh care settings, it is very challenging.  Advice and templates of materials regarding getting, and keeping, this study on busy clinicians' radars is paramount.  Additionally, strategies for finding and recruiting such patients from more consumer-facing settings would be appreciated.

In phase 1, we will build PROMPT-ED incorporating stakeholder input. In phase 2, we will conduct a multi-site pragmatic quasi-experimental trial. We hypothesize that our intervention will improve both the patient-related outcome of health-related quality of life measured 4 weeks post-mTBI and process-related outcomes of the frequency of mTBI diagnosis and issuance of discharge instructions in those who meet mTBI diagnostic criteria.	In phase 1, patient and clinician stakeholders will participate in PROMPT-ED development. In Phase 2, we will conduct a 2-phase quasi-experimental trial. All eligible patients presenting to one of the 4 participating sited EDs will be eligible for study participation. In pre-implementation phase, data will be collected from patients in the ED via the PROs portal and for the follow-up arm at 1 and 4-weeks. These data will not be linked to the EHR or CDS. In post-implementation phase, patient procedures will be identical, but data will be linked to the EHR and visible to treating clinicians, along with CDS. Clinicians will assess the acceptability of both approaches.	Our objective is to improve children's health-related quality of life following mTBI through systematic ED care. To do so we will build a PRO-driven CDS tool, PROMPT-ED (Patient-Reported Outcomes for Mild Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury initiated in the ED), and integrate it into the electronic health record (EHR).This study will pursue 2 specific aims: \n1.\tAssess the impact of PROMPT-ED on HRQoL for children who meet diagnostic criteria for mTBI relative to those in the pre-implementation period.   \n2.\tMeasure the impact of the implemented PROMPT-ED on the ED assessment and management for children with potential mTBI.	Our primary patient-related outcome is health-related quality of life assessed at 4 weeks. Our process-related outcomes are mTBI diagnosis and issuance of discharge instructions for those children who meet the diagnostic criteria for mTBI.  Other tertiary patient-related outcomes include psychosocial functioning, symptom burden, adherence, social support, participation in activities, and health-care utilization assessed at 1 and 4 weeks post-injury. Other tertiary process-related outcomes include screening rates, clinician acceptability,  and impact on ED length of stay	2	For patients enrolled in the quasi-experimental clinical trial:\nInclusion: children from 8-17 years of age who present to the ED within 24 hours following an injury to the brain via a traumatic insult or undergoing an acceleration/deceleration movement, and with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 to 15.  \nExclusion: Patients who are critically ill, have a history of developmental delay or severe mental illness, who present without their legal guardian or are wards of the state or unable to understand English or Spanish (except at sites that currently lack capacity to enroll Spanish patients, e.g. Cincinnati and Philadelphia), will be excluded since these conditions may preclude them from being able to provide informed consent/assent and/or complete self-assessments. \n\nPhase 1 patient usability testers will be recruited based on the same eligibility criteria described above. Patient members of the collaborative design team will be eligible if they have a PAST history of mTBI and otherwise match the eligibility criteria that will be employed in the trial. Participants in the collaborative design team and the usability testing will only be recruited from 2 study sites (CCHMC and CNMC).\n\nClinicians will be eligible complete surveys if they are ED clinicians who could evaluate and diagnose mTBI patients at any of the 4 study sites. Clinician collaborative design team members and usability testers during the development phase of this work will be eligible based on the same criteria, although they will only be recruited from 2 study sites (CCHMC and CNMC).	Four pediatric EDs will enroll participants, all of which are located in the United States:\nCincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC, Cincinnati, OH), Children's National Medical Center (CNMC, Washington, D.C.), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP, Philadelphia, PA), and Children's Hospital Colorado (CHC, Denver, CO).	In Phase 1 of the study, patient and clinician stakeholders will contribute to the development of PROMPT-ED, but no intervention will take place. \n\nIn Phase 2, we will conduct a multisite quasi-experimental clinical trial of the PROMPT-ED intervention. (The full PROMPT-ED intervention will consist of patient-entered symptom reporting via a patient portal, linkage of patient-reported symptoms to the electronic medical record, and clinician decision support based on patient-reported symptoms). In the pre-implementation phase of the intervention research, patient-entered data will be collected but NOT linked to the electronic health record or clinician decision support. Those participants who are approached and consented to the follow-up arm of the study will also complete validated health-related quality of life measures in the ED and at 1 and 4 weeks post-visit. In the post-implementation phase, patient procedures will be the same, but the patient-entered data will be linked to the electronic health record and clinician decision support, and patients will receive context-specific paper and electronic discharge instructions.	Approximately 46 months. This is a 4 year grant, and we anticipate enrolling participants in the Phase 1 collaborative design team within 2 months of study start.	Participants participating in the collaborative design team will meet monthly for the first 2 years. Participants completing the usability testing will attend a single study visit  (although the session may take place several weeks after enrollment).\n\nPatients participating in the quasi-experimental study will complete participation in approximately 4 weeks. All follow-up will be conducted remotely, at 1 and 4 weeks post-ED visit.	No conflicts of interest to report.	Phase 1 does not have a hypothesis-driven aim as it is a process related procedure. For measures with quantitative data, the analyses will be largely descriptive in nature, reporting the measures of central tendency and variability. For the patient usability testing of the PROs portal and the clinical CDS, the think-aloud transcripts will be analyzed to code positive and negative themes related to content or format, understandability, and usefulness of the content. For analysis of the Delphi consensus opinions about the content and format of the discharge instructions, we will use Kappa to estimate the chance adjusted level of agreement among raters based on the compiled ratings for the topics. \n\nThe primary outcome analysis, assessing HRQoL of the patient as measured by the parent PedsQL at 4 weeks, will compare pre-intervention scores to post-intervention scores, controlling for site and time through segmented linear regression, with the individual as the unit of analysis. The secondary outcomes, mTBI diagnosis, and mTBI discharge instructions issuance will both be compared between intervention periods through segmented logistic regression, controlling for site, with the individual as the unit of analysis. For both of these analyses, an interaction term between time and intervention phase (pre vs post) will be assessed. \n\nAll other tertiary outcomes will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons, as these are more exploratory in nature.	\N
292	2018-03-06	55	\N	\N	Pediatric Emergency Department Implementation of SBIRT	PEDI-SBIRT	6	The goal of this application is to conduct a fully powered Type III hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to investigate a comprehensive strategy to improve pediatric emergency department (ED) screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment for adolescent alcohol use. A secondary aim will examine patient outcomes of the clinical intervention, in this case, alcohol and other drug use and follow-up treatment services received. We hypothesize that results of this study will demonstrate that a highly scalable implementation strategy, adapted for the ED setting, will improve the fidelity (i.e., the consistency and quality) of SBIRT delivery in pediatric EDs.	Utilizing a stepped wedge design, six pediatric EDs will receive the PEDI-SBIRT implementation strategy, which utilizes a computerized brief intervention. EDs will enroll 1,008 adolescents who screen positive on the NIAAA two-question screen via the PEDI SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey, in order to assess patient-level data post-discharge. These participants will complete follow up at 1-3 days on the impressions of SBIRT delivery in the ED, 3 months and 6 months post discharge on AOD use. ED nurses and site leaders will be surveyed on organizational readiness for implementation at four time points.	Primary Aim: Evaluate the effectiveness of the pediatric ED implementation for SBIRT (PEDI-SBIRT) strategy in increasing the occurrence and fidelity of SBIRT delivery at EDs, relative to usual care.\nHypothesis: ED staff, after receiving the PEDI-SBIRT strategy will increase by 30% the proportion of adolescents receiving each element of the SBIRT protocol as indicated: a) validated AOD screening, and for those screening positive, b)\nelectronic AOD brief intervention (BI), c) review of printout of change plan from electronic BI by ED nursing staff, and d) where indicated (as defined by NIAAA two question screen guidelines) a referral after ED discharge (i.e., continued AOD\ndiscussion/treatment with a health care provider).\nSecondary Aim 1: Evaluate the effect PEDI-SBIRT has on AOD use at 3 and 6 months following ED discharge. Hypothesis: After the PEDI-SBIRT strategy commences in an ED, adolescents who screen positive on the NIAAA two\nquestion screen and receive the electronic BI will report decreased AOD use at both 3 and 6 month follow-ups, compared to adolescents enrolled in the study during the usual care phase.\nSecondary Aim 2: Evaluate whether ED staff's readiness for organizational change mediates the influence of the PEDI-SBIRT on implementation effectiveness (i.e., fidelity of SBIRT delivery).\nHypothesis: The effect of the PEDI-SBIRT strategy on implementation effectiveness will be partially mediated by ED staff's measured change in organizational readiness to change.\nSecondary Aim 3: Evaluate the effect of PEDI-SBIRT on improving linkage to appropriate care (i.e. continued AOD discussion with primary care provider and/or AOD treatment) following ED discharge.\nHypothesis: Adolescents in EDs that receive the PEDI-SBIRT implementation strategy will report higher rates of AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider within 30 days of discharge, compared to usual care	Primary Aim: Implementation Effectiveness: During the 1-3-day follow up, we will administer the Adolescent Perception of SBIRT Services Survey to enrolled patients via REDCap. Using the NIAAA two-question screen Risk Algorithm, we will calculate site-specific rates for: a) use of NIAAA two-questions screening, and for those screening positive, b) computerized AOD brief intervention (BI), c) review of personalized feedback from computerized BI by ED nursing staff, and d) where indicated, a referral after ED discharge (i.e., continued AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider). The Adolescent Perception of SBIRT Services Survey was developed by the research team to evaluate patient\nexperience of SBIRT services. This instrument is being utilized in our current R01 (Mello; R01AA025914). \nSecondary Aim 1: AOD Use: We will administer a modified Project ASSESS battery to determine AOD use of adolescents at baseline as well as at 3 and 6 months following ED discharge. This battery was administered to nearly 5,000\nadolescent ED patients in our Project ASSESS study and modified battery will contain measures of alcohol and drug use (Drug Use Questionnaire). \nSecondary Aim 2: Organizational readiness for implementing change: Organizational Readiness to Implementing Change, is a 12-item scale which will be implemented to all participating staff at four timepoints (baseline, before the\nPreparation phase, after the Implementation and Sustainability phases) via REDCap. Staff responses to this scale will be used to create an organizational-level measure of each ED's shared perceptions regarding the extent to which their center has the level of skill, training, time, and resources necessary to implement the SBIRT protocol. This measure has been adapted for the proposed study based on the implementation readiness measure developed by Shea and colleagues.\nSecondary Aim 3: Linkage to Appropriate Care: During the 3 and 6 months post discharge follow up, we will administer the Adolescent Perception of Post ED SBIRT Services Survey to patients via REDCap. We define our outcome as the\npercent of adolescents receiving an AOD referral who report linkage to discussions about AOD with a health care provider and/or AOD treatment at 3 and 6 months.	2	Staff:  All ED nurses and identified site leaders from participating institutions will be included.\n\nAdolescent patients: Exclusion criteria will be kept to a minimum:  a) between the ages of 12-17 years; b) treated in one of the participating EDs; c) screened positive for AOD use based on PEDI SBIRT Adolescent Health Survey; d) fluent in English or Spanish; and e) able to provide written assent and parent able to provide written consent.  Exclusion criteria include: in police custody, being evaluated by child protective services, in state custody, ED visit for suicide attempt and any acute conditions that would preclude provision of informed consent (i.e., acute psychosis, altered mental status, cognitive impairment).	6 Injury Free Coalition for Kids sites within the United States ( sites TBD)	PEDI-SBIRT Implementation Strategy consists of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment:\nScreening (S). ED patients age 12-17 years will receive the NIAAA two-question screen (and results recorded in the EMR) during their initial evaluation by nursing staff. A template of the NIAAA two-question screen and clinical informatics technical assistance from Co-I Zonfrillo will be provided to each institution to ease institutional EMR integration. Parents and others will be asked to leave the room during the alcohol screening (and any other sensitive questions for the\nadolescent). Asking the two-question screen in private will establish trust and result in more honest answers. The NIAAA Youth Guide risk estimator will be used to determine adolescents' risk level. \nBrief Intervention (BI). If the teen screens moderate to high risk, the nurse will inform the teen that based on their responses, they will receive a computerized BI. The nurse will explain that this is an independent activity but will ask for\npermission to engage parents in a conversation afterwards. Parent involvement is important in teen BI success and has been linked to better follow through with referral to treatment. If the teen agrees, the nurses will invite parents back into\nthe room after the computerized intervention, compliment the teen for their honesty and frame his/her wanting to involve the parent positively. Personalized feedback/ referral information will be provided to the teen and parent together. \nIf teens do not agree, confidentiality will not be violated (unless they are a serious threat to themselves), and personalized feedback/referral information (where appropriate) will only be provided to the teen. The research team will work with the site leader to design site specific workflows which take into account local and state laws around confidentiality. This was a successful approach in our past implementation studies, with the majority of teen patients choosing to engage their parent in the conversation.\nThe nurse assisted computerized BI, e-Check-Up to Go for alcohol (e-CHUG) is designed as a motivational enhancement therapy to motivate teens to reduce their alcohol use. e-CHUG is divided into three parts: assessment, personalized\nfeedback, and personal reflections. After completing the program, which takes about 25 minutes, the nurse will review personalized feedback which contains information on potential behavior changes based on teen responses, and check\nin with the adolescent to answer any questions that may have arisen.  \nReferral to Treatment (RT). Upon discharge, the nurse will provide the personalized feedback form along with the standard discharge instructions. Based on recommendations from the NIAAA Youth Guide, those screening moderate risk will be referred back to their primary care provider, and those screening high risk will be referred to their medical home and further AOD treatment resources. These AOD specific instructions will be incorporated into the discharge instructions based on the patient's NIAAA two-question screen results.	Study start up will occur for the first six months of the study. The study will run from month 6 through month 54. Institutions will enroll patients during the Usual Care and Sustainability phases (this will vary by institution based on their randomization to the PEDI-SBIRT strategy in the stepped wedge design). Data analysis will occur from month 54 to month 60.	Patients will be followed for 6 months.	Nothing to disclose.	Primary Aim: We will report descriptive statistics to summarize each element of the SBIRT. Our primary comparison for each of these will be pre- vs. post-intervention among those who screen positive. We will compare rates using\nsite-6-months as the unit of analysis. Standard stepped-wedge analysis techniques will be used. Specifically, the site-month rate will be the outcome in a linear model to examine the effect of receiving the PEDI-SBIRT on the rate of\ncompletion of each element. In the model, we will include an effect for each site, as well as an effect for each 6-month period, which will control for temporal trends. An intervention effect will be included and we will test for a difference\nbetween pre- and post-intervention at a 5% significance level. \nSecondary Aims: We will use a similar stepped-wedge analysis to test for a change in AOD use. In this case, however, the unit of analysis will be the participant, and we will once again include both site and time effects. We will\nalso perform a similar analysis on the rate of AOD discussion/treatment with a health care provider.\nIn order to explore mediation of ED staff's readiness for organizational change on the effectiveness of PEDI-SBIRT implementation, we will perform the following steps. First, we will use the model derived in the analysis of the primary aim to create two additional models: (1) a model with ED staff readiness added as a predictor and (2) a model using ED staff readiness to replace adherence rate as the outcome. Based on the latter model, we will simulate predicted mediator\nvalues for each observation under both pre- and post-intervention circumstances. These predictions will then be used in the first new model to simulate the adherence rate and counterfactual (using ED staff readiness predicted under pre-intervention) corresponding to post-intervention. The mediation effect is the average of the differences in outcome across all units of analysis. We will perform repeated simulation to estimate the uncertainty and to test whether the mediation effect is 0. We will perform sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding.\nPower and Sample Size Considerations:\nPrimary Aim: We plan to enroll at 6 Injury Free Coalition for Kids sites. Based on experience with the ASSESS study, we conservatively anticipate that approximately 4 per month per site will screen positive for alcohol risk, leading to approximately 24 per site per 6-month period. We believe current rates of adherence to the elements of SBIRT to be near 0. We will conservatively estimate baseline adherence to be 5%. For the purpose of power calculations, we assume a standard deviation in rates\nacross sites of 8.7%. Based on expected enrollment of 24 per 6 months per site, we will have approximately 80% power to detect a 9.0% difference in adherence rates and 90% power to detect a difference of about 10.8%. Confidence intervals around detection rates in each of the screening strategy groups will be +/- 2-3%. Change in AOD use: With approximately 500 participants pre-intervention and 500 post-intervention, we will have 80% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.18 and 90% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.21. Tanner-Smith and Risser19 (ref) found an effect size (standardized) of about 0.21 for frequency of heavy drinking and 0.14 for quantity of drinking.	\N

Secondary:    To evaluate the safety of intracranial administration of autologous peripheral nerve grafts at the time of deep brain stimulation surgery to the substantia nigra.    Our central hypothesis is that Schwann cells derived from autologous sural nerve grafts may provide neurotrophic support through delivery of GDNF, BDNF, NT-3, NGF and other factors and support molecules in vivo. This in vivo support of damaged or dying dopamine neurons (sural nerve grafts to SN) form the basis of a therapy to possibly alter the progression of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD).	-Multi center, double-blind, randomized, sham-surgery controlled study of stereotactic, intracranial autologous peripheral nerve grafts to the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery  -Phase II  -Thr	Specific Aim 1: Clinical evaluations of the effects of implanting unilateral autologous sural nerve grafts to the SN in participants with PD receiving DBS surgery.  Examine the effect of peripheral nerve graft (single and multi-target delivery) on motor scores (MDS-UPDRS Part III) off/off DBS and medications (minimum 12 hours) at baseline, 6 and 12 months after grafting.  Secondary efficacy endpoints are comparing gait parameters, MDS-UPDRS III evaluations on/on DBS and medications. In addition, imaging studies of dopamine transporter binding (DaTscan�) at baseline and 12 months after grafting. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of implanting unilateral autologous sural nerve grafts to the substantia nigra in participants with PD receiving DBS therapy. Participants who have selected and consented to DBS of the GPi will receive autologous, sural nerve grafts implanted unilaterally into one or two sites within the substantia nigra during DBS surgery. Safety will be continuously monitored in real time and adverse events reported.	Primary endpoint data for clinical efficacy will be based on MDS-UPDRS (motor) scores in the 'off' treatment state.  This is appropriate for evaluating disease progression.  Changes in MDS-UPDRS scores will be compared internally to preoperative baseline 'off' scores, where each subject serves as his/her own control, and to control subjects who receive no graft.  As this is a randomized, double blinded, study, Group 2 will represent the placebo group.  The true placebo effect will be evaluated by comparing to a separate group of patients currently being evaluated for disease progression.  This external group is non blinded, receives DBS therapy, and is tested each year for disease progression in the 'off' state.          Given the additional minimal risk of the grafting procedure (based on our pilot study findings) our primary clinical efficacy endpoint would be an improvement in the MDS-UPDRS III score of at least 7 points, compared to pre-op baseline, in at least one third of the patients greater than the same improvement observed in the placebo control group.  The 7-point improvement represents a moderate clinically important difference in the MDS-UPDRS score.	1	Participant Inclusion Criteria    Participants must meet all of the inclusion criteria in order to be eligible to participate in the study.    1.                   Undergoing unilateral DBS of the GPi    2.                   Age 40-75, inclusive    3.                   Able to give informed consent    4.                   Show a positive response to carbidopa/levodopa    5.                   Able and willing to undergo SPECT imaging    6.                   Able to tolerate the surgical procedure    7.                   Able to undergo all planned neurological assessments    8.                   Available access to the sural nerve      Participant Exclusion Criteria    All individuals meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from study participation.    1.       Any condition that would not make the subject a candidate for DBS of the GPi    2.       Under the age of 40 or over the age of 75    3.       Unable to give informed consent    4.       Previous PD surgery or intracranial surgery    5.       Female who is pregnant, lactating, or of child-bearing potential unwilling to use an adequate birth control method during the period of the study	Not provided.	Subjects will undergo a standard two stage DBS surgery procedure.  Stage I surgery is preparatory, is performed under general anesthesia, and includes the placement of the pulse generator and tunneling of the lead extension from the pulse generator pocket incision just below the collar bone to the scalp behind the ear.  It is during this surgery that a sural nerve graft will be prepared for harvesting for the second stage of the surgery.  This is accomplished through a standard neurosurgical approach used for biopsy of the sural nerve.  A 3-4 cm incision is made just above and behind the lateral aspect of the ankle.  The sural nerve lies in the subcutaneous space, is easily identified, and is then isolated and transected distally.  A small silk suture is loosely placed around the segment.  The suture serves as a marker for identification for harvesting during the second stage.  Transecting the nerve initiates the injury response of growth factor production.  Stage II surgery includes the placement of the DBS electrode utilizing frame-based stereotactic guidance and microelectrode recordings to confirm targeting.  The DBS electrode will be placed according to standard clinical practice.  For Group 1: participants will be receiving peripheral nerve grafts (single delivery or two deliveries) unilaterally to one substantia nigra after the DBS electrodes has been placed successfully.  For this component, the previously created incision in the ankle region is re-opened under local anesthesia, the marking stitch is identified, and the sural nerve is transected about 2 cm proximal to the previous distal transaction.  The nerve segment is then placed in normal sterile saline and trimmed for loading into the transplant cannula.  The graft, ~0.8mm in diameter and ~1cm in length is then deposited stereotactically into the substantia nigra. One cohort will receive a single graft deployment to the substantia nigra which recapitulates the premise of our pilot studies.  The second cohort will receive two separate graft deployments to the substantia, spatially separated by 4-5 mm in the AP-ML plane.  This represents a 'dose escalation' by doubling the graft material and increasing the potential sphere of influence of the grafted tissue.  All incisions are then closed in the standard, surgical, subcuticlular fashion.  In this way, the study portion of the procedure will not interfere with the scheduled DBS surgery or treatment.  For Group 2: participants will receive a sham incision to the ankle but will not receive peripheral nerve graft to the substantia nigra.	Not provided.	Not provided.	No disclosures	\N	\N
207	2017-09-28	5	\N	\N	A Randomized Controlled Trial of Abdominal Ultrasound (FAST) in Children with Blunt Torso Trauma	A RCT of FAST in Children	4	The proposal's goal is to conduct a RCT studying an evaluation strategy with abdominal ultrasound (FAST) versus a strategy without FAST for the initial evaluation of children with blunt abdominal trauma.  We will compare the 1) rate of abdominal CT scanning and 2) the rate of missed/delayed diagnosis of intra-abdominal injuries in those that randomize to FAST versus those that do not.  In addition, we seek to identify patient, physician, and system factors associated with obtaining CT in patients considered very low risk for intra-abdominal injury after a negative FAST examination.  We hypothesize use of FAST will improve clinical care.	Abdominal ultrasound (FAST) safely decreases abdominal CT rates in injured adults but has unclear impact in children as current evidence from observational studies and a single center RCT are conflicting.  We therefore, propose a multicenter (6 center) RCT (phase 3) to study the FAST examination.   Injured children will be blocked randomized (by age cohorts) to receive FAST or no FAST (1:1 randomization).   As the FAST examination is performed and interpreted by the treating clinician at the time of initial evaluation, clinicians are not masked to the intervention.  Research coordinators, however, will be masked to randomization group when assessing outcome measures.	To perform a RCT of FAST for pediatric trauma during Emergency Department evaluation and compare the rates of abdominal CT scanning between children in the FAST and no FAST arms.  Significance: Decreased abdominal CT use will increase patient safety by decreasing the risks of radiation-induced malignancies. \n\nTo identify if an Emergency Department evaluation strategy including the FAST examination results in fewer cases of missed or delayed diagnosis of intra-abdominal injuries than a strategy not employing the FAST.  Significance: Physician acceptance of an evaluation strategy involving the FAST will likely depend on that strategy not missing patients with intra-abdominal injuries. \n\nTo identify patient, physician, and system factors associated with obtaining CT imaging in patients considered very low risk for intra-abdominal injury by the Emergency Medicine clinician after a negative FAST examination.  Identification of modifiable factors for obtaining abdominal CT scans in patients considered very low risk for intra-abdominal injury after a negative FAST examination will provide the initial steps for improving future care.	Endpoints were chosen based on the findings from two adult RCTs (Rose JS. Journal of Trauma 2001;51(3):545 and Melniker LA. Annals of Emergency Medicine  2006;48(3):227), one pediatric observational study (Menaker J. Journal of Trauma 2014;77(3):427) and one pediatric RCT (Holmes JF. JAMA 2017;317(22):2290)\n\nThe primary endpoints of this study are: \n1) Abdominal CT rate: The abdominal CT rate will be assessed as the proportion of CT scans obtained in the Emergency Department on patients enrolled into the study. \n2) Missed intra-abdominal injury rate.  Missed intra-abdominal injuries will be defined as an intra-abdominal injury diagnosed after Emergency Department evaluation (this includes any time period after the patient leaves the Emergency Department).   \n\nSecondary endpoints of this study are: \n1. Emergency Department length of stay; The Emergency Department length of stay is defined as the time from Emergency Department arrival to the time when admission or discharge orders are written.\n2. Hospitalization rate from the Emergency Department: The hospitalization rate will be assessed as the rate of admission to the hospital (observation, ward or intensive care unit admission) in patients enrolled into the study. \n3. Rate of abdominal CT in children 0 - 3 years of age: The abdominal CT rate in children 0 - 3 years of age will be assessed as the proportion of CT scans obtained in the Emergency Department on patients enrolled into the study in this age cohort.	2	The inclusion and criteria are the same as used in a single center RCT. (Holmes JF. JAMA 2017;317(22):2290)\n\nInclusion Criteria\nChildren younger than 18 years with blunt abdominal trauma presenting to the participating ED within 24 hours of the traumatic event will be eligible.  Inclusion criteria include any one of the following:\n• Blunt torso trauma resulting from a significant mechanism of injury \n        * Motor vehicle collision: greater than 60 mph, ejection, or rollover \n        *Automobile versus pedestrian/bicycle: automobile speed > 25 mph\n\t*Falls greater than 20 feet in height\n\t*Crush injury to the torso\n\t*Physical assault involving the abdomen\n• Decreased level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13- 15 or below age-appropriate behavior) in association with blunt torso trauma\n• Blunt traumatic event with any of the following (regardless of the mechanism):\n\t*Extremity paralysis\n        *Multiple long bone fractures (e.g., tibia and humerus fracture) \n• History and physical examination suggestive of intra-abdominal injury following blunt torso trauma of any mechanism (including mechanisms of injury of less severity than mentioned above)\n\nThe following patients will be excluded from the study: \n• Hypotension (Hemodynamic instability)\n\t*Patients will be excluded for prehospital or initial ED hypotension.  This is because the standard evaluation of these \n         patients involves immediate FAST based on prior work by our group. Hypotension is age determined. \n• Penetrating trauma: Patients who are victims of stab or gunshot wounds  \n• Traumatic injury occurring > 24 hours prior to the time of presentation to the ED\n• Transfer of the patient to the ED from an outside facility with abdominal CT scan, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, or laparotomy previously performed\n• Patients with known disease processes resulting in intraperitoneal fluid including liver failure and the presence of ventriculoperitoneal shunts	We have identified six sites to participate in the study.  All sites have an acceptable number of injured children presenting to their site and have agreed to randomize children to receive FAST or no FAST.  Based on preliminary data, the abdominal CT rates for eligible patients range from 36.5% to 68.3% (average 51.4%).  The six cites are as follows:\n\n• UC Davis Medical Center is a level 1 trauma center in Sacramento, California (1,650 injured children/year).\n• Children's Hospital of Colorado is a level 1 trauma center in Denver, Colorado (1,600 injured children/year).\n• Children's National Medical Center is a level 1 trauma center in Washington DC (1,500 injured children/year).\n• Cincinnati Children's Hospital is a level 1 trauma center in Cincinnati, Ohio (1.900 injured children/year). \n• Nationwide Children's Hospital is a level 1 trauma center in Columbus, Ohio (1,645 injured children/year).\n• The Children's Hospital at OU Medical Center is a level 1 trauma center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1,400 injured children/year).	Bedside FAST examinations will be performed on patients randomized to the FAST arm by the Emergency Department physicians providing care to the patient.  These physicians will be credentialed in FAST examinations prior to the start of the study as required by the Department/Division of Emergency Medicine at each study site.  FAST examinations will be performed using a portable ultrasound scanner with 3.5 MHz and 5.0 MHz curvilinear transducers.  We will adhere to the ultrasound protocol for the detection of intraperitoneal fluid (FAST examination).  This protocol includes views of Morison's pouch (right upper quadrant), splenorenal fossa (left upper quadrant), long and short axis of the pelvis and the heart.  Images of eFAST (FAST plus pulmonary images) will not be required but this information will be collected on the data collection form if obtained by the clinician. There will be no attempt to image the solid organs, as this is not routine in the standard FAST examination.  All FAST examinations will be uploaded and backed up at the central Department/Division of Emergency Medicine ultrasound server. Image archival will be through password protected Osirix image data management software.  ED clinicians (faculty or fellow) caring for the patients will make bedside interpretations and record them on the case report forms.  The Emergency Department clinicians may be of any specialty providing care to the patient (Emergency Medicine, Surgery, etc). For purposes of analysis, bedside FAST examinations will be classified as positive if any intraperitoneal fluid is identified and classified as negative if no such fluid is noted.   The Emergency Department clinician will also document the location of fluid on all positive examinations.  We will not collect data on incidental findings or specify how the treating clinicians evaluate any incidental findings that they may incidentally see or specifically evaluate the patient for.  Clinical action based on FAST findings will be at the discretion of the treating physician.	In the UC Davis pilot RCT of abdominal ultrasound, 925 (74%) of 1,250 eligible patients were enrolled over 37 months (25 enrolled patients/month).  We have selected sites with eligible patient volumes similar to UC Davis and thus anticipate sites will evaluate at least 20 patients/month.  Assuming a similar enrollment rate of 74%, we conservatively anticipate each site will enroll at least 15 patients/month (180 patients/year/site).  Assuming six sites (including UC Davis) enroll patients, the study will require up to 3.5 years of patient enrollment (15 patients/month * 6 sites * 42 months = 3,780).   Thus, we believe we may reach our sample size of 3,268 patients within 3.5 months.  We anticipate, however, that enrolling the necessary numbers of patients in the 0 - 3 age cohort will take longer.  Approximately 20% of enrolled patients will be in the 0 - 3 age cohort (3 enrolled patients/month).  Assuming the six sites enroll 3 patients/month (36 patients/year/site) in the 0-3 age cohort, it may require up to 48 months to meet the sample size of 814 patients (3 patients/month * 6 sites * 48 months = 864).  Thus we will plan on enrolling patients for 48 months. \n \nIn addition to 4 years of patient enrollment, we plan 6 months prior to patient enrollment to prepare all sites for patient enrollment.  Following the last patient enrollment, we plan 6 months of final data cleaning and data analysis. Thus, we plan a 5 year study.	The period of time the patient is followed in the study is described below.  These follow-up procedures have been refined and successful in multiple prior multicenter studies conducted by the investigators. \n\nHospitalized patients: Patients will be hospitalized at the discretion of the treating physicians.  Data from each patient's electronic medical record will be collected after discharge for determination of outcome status.  \n\nPatients discharged home from the ED: The guardians/parents/responsible family member of all patients will receive an information sheet describing the study.  This information sheet will notify guardians of patients discharged from the ED that they will be contacted by telephone/texting (we have successfully implemented texting procedure for follow-up in prior studies) by the Research Coordinator one to two weeks after the Emergency Department visit.  The Research Coordinator will complete this survey in order to document any possible missed intra-abdominal injuries (as determined by return visit to a healthcare facility during which an intra-abdominal injury is documented). If we are unable to contact the patient's guardian after four telephone follow-up (or texting) attempts extending to three months after the Emergency Department visit, we will review the patient's electronic medical records and Emergency Department and trauma continuous quality improvement records to identify any study patients with possible missed intra-abdominal injuries.   \n\nMissed eligible patients: Although we anticipate that most (74% based on the UC Davis RCT) eligible patients will be enrolled in the study, it is inevitable that some eligible patients will inadvertently be missed.  These patients will be identified by the Research Coordinator (on review of electronic health record, clinical and outcome information and basic demographic about these patients will be documented on a case report form.  This will allow some general comparisons between enrolled and missed patients in order to assess the possibility of enrollment bias.	The team has no conflicts of interest or financial ties to this study.	A brief description of the statistical plan for the study is provided below.\n\nAll analyses will account for stratification by site and age group. Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory data, and outcome measures will be compared between the two cohorts (FAST arm versus the no-FAST arm) using appropriate bivariate statistical methods to assess for parity between arms in known confounding variables (i.e., hypotension, pediatric trauma score).  Ninety-five percent confidence intervals will be calculated for all measures of interest. All tests will be based on two-tailed alternatives. P-values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Categorical data will be compared using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for stratified samples. If small cell counts occur we will consider using the exact version of the test. Continuous data will be compared with the van Elteren test to account for stratification.\n\nPrimary Endpoint\nRate of Abdominal CT scanning. The primary outcome is if a patient undergoes an abdominal CT scan which is a categorical variable (yes/no). We will use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to determine if differences exist between the two arms. \n\nRate of delayed/missed intra-abdominal injuries. In our prior multicenter observational blunt abdominal trauma study (n=12,044), there were three patients with delays in diagnosis (i.e., patients diagnosed with intra-abdominal injury in the hospital after Emergency Department disposition) among the patients with intra-abdominal injuries, and one patient with a missed intra-abdominal injury (intra-abdominal injury diagnosed after discharged from the Emergency Department).  In the UC Davis FAST RCT, one case of missed intra-abdominal injury was identified and this was likely a false positive abdominal CT scan.  Although these outcomes are very important, they are of insufficient frequency to be used for sample size determination.  We will simply identify and report any cases of missed/delayed diagnoses in both the FAST arm and no-FAST arm.\n\nSecondary Endpoints \nEmergency Department length of stay. Emergency Department length of stay is a continuous variable measured in minutes.  We will compare the length of stay using the van Elteren test.  \n \nHospitalization rate from the Emergency Department.  Hospitalization is a categorical variable (yes/no).  We will use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to determine if differences exist between the two arms.\n\nRate of abdominal CT in children 0 - 3 years of age. We will evaluate the rate of abdominal CT scanning in the youngest age group.  This rate is a categorical variable (yes/no). We will use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to determine if differences exist between the two arms.	We anticipate that all sites would be actively enrolling within 6 months of the start of the study (defined as the time funding becomes available). \n\nAs previously described, we anticipate that each site will enroll 15 subjects/month of whom 3 subjects/month will be in the 0-3 age cohort.  Study duration will likely be driven by enrollment in the 0 - 3 age cohort.  Assuming the six sites enroll 3 patients/month (36 patients/year/site) in the 0-3 age cohort, it may require up to 48 months to meet the sample size of 814 patients (3 patients/month * 6 sites * 48 months = 864).  We anticipate that once we reach 814 subjects in the 0 -3 age cohort, we will have met the total sample size of 3,268 subjects.

A core outcome is defined as "a patient outcome, health-related condition, or aspects of health that relevant stakeholders agree are essential to assess in all clinical research studies evaluating outcomes"1. The COS will serve as a guideline resource for investigators to assure that outcomes most important to all stakeholders are considered in PCCM clinical research programs.	The first aim of the study will be to create a comprehensive list of outcomes for consideration by stakeholders for inclusion the PICU COS. This will be done by conducting a scoping review of published studies of survivors of pediatric critical illness, evaluating which physical, cognitive, emotional, social, quality of life and other outcomes have been commonly reported in the literature. Then families with children who have survived critical illness will be interviewed over phone to explore family and child perceptions of health issues or outcomes that are needed to be included in studies that can potentially inform how to improve children's health once they are discharged from the PICU.	The objective of this study is to develop a COS for PCCM research. Typically, research priorities and elements of study design such as outcomes are determined by investigators without input from other invested stakeholders such as patients, their families, advocacy groups, and clinicians. The importance of including multiple stakeholders in the development of research study design including COS is increasingly recognized. In addition to the inclusion of stakeholder-supported outcomes, other benefits of COS include minimizing bias and heterogeneity in choice and reporting of outcomes, which can improve the quality of systematic reviews and buy-in from stakeholders in the implementation of research findings. \n\nCOS are meant to serve as a minimum set of outcomes and do not exclude other outcomes that may be important for a particular study. We intend to utilize guidelines for COS development and reporting by the Core Outcomes Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative. Recent work by Needham et al exemplify these methods in their development of Core Outcomes and Core Measurement Sets for adults with acute lung injury which included patients, family, clinical, research, and funding agency stakeholders.	To develop a comprehensive list of outcomes for the Delphi process, which will inform the guidelines for outcome inclusion in PCCM research programs.	1	Inclusion criteria\n1.\tA family with a child aged 10-17 who survived unplanned PICU admission or a parent/guardian (any age) whose child (any age) survived an unplanned PICU admission\n2.\tGreater than 48-hour PICU stay\n3.\tThree to twelve months post discharge\n4.\tEnglish speaking	8 sites in the the network: CHOM, CHOP, CNMC, NWCH, DECH, UPMC, UCLA, UCSF	\N	24 months	One hour interviews is the limit of subject participation	\N	\N	\N

Introduced as a medicinal product more than 100 years ago, aspirin significantly reduces ischemic outcomes such as myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with previous cardiovascular events and/or atherosclerosis at a cost of less than a cent per day. However, despite dozens of clinical trials involving more than 200,000 patients, the optimal dose of aspirin-the dose that is most effective in reducing ischemic events in the setting of secondary prevention, balanced by the potential for adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding-has not been determined in direct comparative-effectiveness trials.\n\nTo identify the optimal dose of aspirin for secondary prevention in patients with ASCVD, we will participate in a pragmatic clinical trial in which 20,000 patients who are at high risk for ischemic events will be recruited from 34 healthcare institutions from across the country and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive an aspirin dose of 81 mg/day vs. 325 mg/day.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
250	2018-01-15	7	\N	\N	Point-of-care ultrasound in the evaluation of the acutely ill patients	Point-of-care ultrasound study	6	The specific aim of the study is to determine if implementation of ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol improves morbidity and mortality in patients presenting to the ICU with cardiopulmonary instability. Our central hypothesis is that the use of an ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol leads to narrowed differential diagnoses and timely intervention, therefore an improvement in morbidity and mortality.	We will conduct a multi-center (8 centers, targeting small to medium-sized ICUs, including the ICUs run by acute care nurse practitioners) prospective cluster randomized study, in which providers in the intensive care units (ICUs) randomized to intervention will complete a 2-month educational course in performing an ultrasound-guided patient evaluation protocol. Providers in the control ICUs will use a standard approach in evaluating their patients. The study implementation period will be 5 months. After the 5-month period, providers in the control ICUs will receive the same ultrasound training for their own education outside of our study.	The specific aim of the study is to determine if implementation of ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol improves morbidity and mortality in patients presenting to the ICU with cardiopulmonary instability.	The primary outcome of the study is the mean daily MSOFA score (maximum of 16, excluding central nervous system) while the patients are in the ICU (up to 28 days). We consider a MSOFA difference of 0.5 to be clinically meaningful. The secondary outcomes are lengths of ICU and hospital stay, days free from advanced cardiac, respiratory, and renal support, and 28-day hospital mortality.	1	Provider inclusion criteria:\n•\tProviders (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) who evaluate ICU patients at their initial presentation.\n\nProvider exclusion criteria:\n•\tNone.\n\nPatient inclusion criteria:\n•\tAge 18 years or older\n•\tFirst admission or transfer to the ICU during hospitalization\n•\tPatients with circulatory or respiratory instability (see the definition below) as an initial presentation to the ICU\n\nPatient exclusion criteria: \n•\tPatients previously hospitalized to ICU during the study period (to avoid duplicate patient data collection)\n•\tTransfer from another medical center within 48 hours of ICU admission/transfer\n•\tComfort measures and/or palliative care\n•\tRefusal to consent to use of medical records for research purposes\n\nDefinitions:\n[Circulatory instability] \nMeeting at least one of the criteria below\n•\tAcute chest pain suggestive of ischemia\n•\tAcute change in heart rate and/or rhythm that warrants an ICU level of care (including, but not limited to heart rate <40/min or >130/min, and significant changes in rhythm from the baseline)\n•\tAcute change in blood pressure that warrants an ICU level of care, (including, but not limited to systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or >160mmHg, and significant changes in mean arterial pressure >15mmHg from the baseline)\n•\tOne or more sign of inadequate perfusion; abnormal lactate level (>2mmol/L), decreased urine output <0.5mg/kg/hr for 2 hours, and central venous oxygen saturation level of <70%\n•\tOne or more sign of organ damage with hypertension; papilledema, chest pain, arrhythmia, headache, dyspnea, altered mental status, acute kidney injury, and vomiting.\n•\tUse of intravenous vasoactive or inotropic agents\n•\tUse of intravenous antihypertensive or antiarrhythmic agents\n•\tUse of mechanical circulatory supports\n\n[Respiratory instability]\nMeeting at least one of the criteria below\n•\tAcute dyspnea\n•\tAcute change in respiratory rate that warrants an ICU level of care (including, but not limited to RR <10/min or >28/min)\n•\tAcute decline in oxygen saturation that warrants an ICU level of care (including, but not limited to SpO2<90% or significant changes in supplemental oxygen requirement)\n•\tUse of non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation	We plan to include small to medium-sized community-based ICUs, including the ICUs run by acute care nurse practitioners. Since randomization of individual patients is often challenging in studies in acute care settings, a cluster randomized design is the most appropriate for assessing the impact of implementation of the new ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol. Our phone survey to critical care directors in the community-based ICUs revealed that a conventional cluster randomized trial is preferred to a stepped wedge design, because of its relative convenience in scheduling a 2-month education intervention period (randomized either pre- or post-implementation period) from an administrative perspective, without having significant methodological disadvantages. Additionally, conducting a clinical study in community-based ICUs, including the ICUS run by acute care nurse practitioners, where majority of people receive health care, is also essential to understanding effectiveness of an intervention in the real-world critical care practice settings.\nCenter inclusion criteria:\n•\tMedical, cardiac, surgical, neurology, trauma, or combined ICUs with more than 10 beds\n•\tThe average monthly number of new ICU patients with circulatory or respiratory instability (see the definition below) is at least 40.\n•\tThis is to ensure the adequate patient enrollment (see the statistical statement below). \n•\tICU's in which point-of-care ultrasound is not routinely conducted at the initial patient evaluation (less than one examination per every 10 new admissions)\n•\tA site sonographer or investigator available for bedside ultrasound education\n•\tTen or less providers (nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians) per ICU\n•\tThis is to ensure the quality of ultrasound education offered to providers.\n•\tAll providers are willing to undergo ultrasound education, attain minimal ultrasound competency (see the definition below), and comply with the ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol during the study period.\n•\tUse of electronic medical record with a computer-based screening feature to retrospectively collect and analyze eligible patients' data in the post-implementation period.\n\nCenter exclusion criteria:\n•\tPediatric ICUs	Providers in the ICUs randomized to intervention will complete a 2-month educational course in performing an ultrasound-guided patient evaluation protocol, while providers in the control ICUs will receive no education or guidance. Specifically, providers in the intervention ICUs will undergo a multi-media hybrid (online and on-site hands-on workshop) ultrasound education program. Subsequently, providers will be asked to take an ultrasound test at the end of this period to ensure their attainment of minimal ultrasound competency (see the definition of minimal ultrasound competency below). Providers are expected to become proficient in identifying eligible patients, performing an ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol, and acquainted with a treatment suggestion algorithm.\n\n[Minimal ultrasound competency]\n•\tProviders pass both online knowledge (more than 80% accuracy) and hands-on skill tests (more than 80% of checklist items) during an intervention period.  \n•\tIf providers fail the online knowledge test in their first attempt, they are allowed to repeat the test one more time.\n•\tIf providers fail the hands-on skill test, they are allowed to repeat the test once they have conducted 5 supervised ultrasound examinations with a site sonographer or a site investigator.	A total study duration will be 18 months. \nRecruitment period (4 months): We plan to use website postings, flyers, and emails to recruit ICU's that meet the center inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study protocol will be shared with potential site investigators and coordinators. We will obtain data on the number of potentially eligible patients per month in each center. This data collection will also assist us with conducing block stratification in a subsequent randomization phase. Oral consent will be obtained from participating providers.  \n\nRandomization: Centers will be randomized to an ultrasound-guided evaluation (intervention) or a standard of care (control) group. They enter the study using a stratified block randomization to ensure balance in the number of sites assigned to the two groups. The blocks will be stratified by the number of potentially eligible patients identified in a recruitment period per ICU to ensure that particular center characteristic is balanced between the two groups. \n\nIntervention period (2 months): Providers in the intervention ICUs will undergo a multi-media hybrid (online and on-site hands-on workshop) ultrasound education program. Subsequently, providers will be asked to take an ultrasound test at the end of this period to ensure their attainment of minimal ultrasound competency. Providers are expected to become proficient in identifying eligible patients, performing an ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol, and acquainted with a treatment suggestion algorithm. Providers in the control ICUs receive no education or guidance. \n\nImplementation period (5 months): Providers at intervention ICUs will be encouraged to perform an ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol and consider proposed treatment suggestions on their eligible patients in their initial (mandatory) and follow-up (optional) evaluation. Providers will have ongoing access to online ultrasound education materials. Providers in the control ICUs will use a current standard approach in evaluating their patients. They will be allowed to use ultrasound if it is their preferred evaluation approach. \n\nPost-implementation and data analysis period (7 months): Upon completion of the implementation period, patient data will be retrospectively collected via chart review and analyzed under intent-to-treat principles based on randomization at the ICU level. All ICU patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be analyzed regardless of providers' use of ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol, their ultrasound competency, or adherence to our treatment suggestion algorithm. Providers in the control ICUs will receive both online and hands-on ultrasound training outside of this study for their own education.	\N	\N	Provider data\nNo protected health information will be obtained from providers during the study. Oral consent will be obtained for study participation. We will collect providers' position (nurse practitioners, physician assistants, physicians, etc.), knowledge and skill test scores, and attainment of minimal ultrasound competency. \n\nPatient data\nAlthough there is no direct patient care related intervention, patients' protected health information (baseline characteristics, hospital course, morbidity, and mortality) will be collected retrospectively via chart review upon completion of the study implementation period. It would not be practically possible to obtain informed consent from all acutely ill patients or their surrogates at the time of initial clinical assessment. Obtaining a retrospective consent is also not practical in this patient population whose mortality is significantly high, and exclusion of such patient data will make the study unfeasible. Our intervention is the introduction of a structured non-invasive ultrasound-guided evaluation in the current clinical practice where an ultrasound examination has been performed in a non-structured, convenient manner. Therefore, we will request a waiver of HIPAA authorization and informed consent for patient study participation.\nStudy data will be analyzed under intent-to-treat principles based on randomization at the ICU level. All ICU patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be analyzed regardless of providers' use of ultrasound-guided evaluation protocol, their ultrasound competency, or adherence to our treatment suggestion algorithm. Patient specific data will be summarized using frequencies and percentages for categorical data and means and standard deviations for continuous data. The primary outcome of the mean MSOFA and the other secondary outcomes will be compared between intervention and control ICU's using a hierarchical generalized or linear mixed effects model.

The primary outcome will be glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c 3 months after intervention delivery. Secondary outcomes will include diabetes self-management behaviors, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, and body mass index.	1	Eligibility criteria will include 1) self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, 2) age between 18 and 70 years, 3) receive primary care at one of the participating clinical sites, 4) at least one office visit within the previous 12 months to the primary care site, 5) diagnosis of T2D in the medical record, 6) T2D diagnosis for six months or longer, 7) most recent hemoglobin A1c≥8%, and 8) intention to continue to receive medical care at the recruitment clinic for the next six months.	Study Sites\n     Both clinical sites participated in the pilot testing of the intervention and in refinement of study procedures for the proposed trial. Our letters of support indicate strong investment and commitment to accomplish this study, and study personnel have been identified at both sites: \n•\tHennepin County Medical Center (HCMC), Minneapolis, MN. HCMC is a large public academic healthcare institution that provides primary care to approximately 90,000 patients in Hennepin County, MN, a large proportion of whom are Hispanic.  Members of our study team have worked with HCMC investigators for the past three years on diabetes care for immigrant patients.  \n•\tMountain Park Health Center (MPHC), Phoenix, AZ.  MPHC is a community health center with more than 30 years of experience. MPHC provides primary care for approximately 60,000 patients.  Demographically, the vast majority of patients seen at MPHC are Hispanic.  MPHC has a long history of mission-driven research collaboration with Mayo Clinic.  \n\n     Rationale for study site selection.  The study will take place at HCMC and MPHC because of their high volume of adult Hispanic patients with T2D, their strong history of research collaboration with Mayo Clinic, and because of a personal history of collaboration between the PIs and site-PIs (including pilot work for this application).  The intervention was initially created with RHCP community partners and Rochester, MN was included as a pilot site.  As in the pilot study, Mayo Clinic team members who have substantial expertise with clinical trial coordination and oversight will continue to perform this role (i.e., coordination and oversight) in the proposed study as described below.	Digital storytelling intervention.  The digital intervention package, which is 12 minutes long, includes a brief introduction by an RHCP community partner, four stories with transitions, and a short closing educational message re-enforcing the four diabetes self-management behavioral goals (healthful diet, physical activity, medication adherence, glucose self-monitoring).  The storytellers include two women and two men; they reflect some of the heterogeneity among Hispanic/Latino subgroups (two Mexican, one Central American, and one South American) in the U.S.  After obtaining consent in the clinical setting, study staff will deliver the intervention in the exam room or in a separate private room.  We chose to have the patient view the video on-site so that all participants are exposed to the video, ensuring adherence. \n     Following the video exposure, study staff will ask these questions to each participant and record their answers: 1) What is your reaction to the video?, 2) What was the main message of the video, and 3) Does the video motivate you to make any changes to the way you manage your diabetes (probe positive responses)?  These questions will confirm participant receipt of the intervention, which is an important fidelity construct to ensure that participants received and understood the intervention101.   \n     Participants will be offered a copy of the video either as a portable storage device (i.e., "flash drive") for viewing on a computer or a DVD for viewing on a television.  Participants will also be provided access to the storytelling intervention as an application on their mobile phones and/or tablets.  In our pilot of the storytelling intervention, all participants cited the use of mobile smart phones.  Study staff will offer to assist participants in downloading this application during the baseline visit, and encourage participants to watch the video with family members or friends within their support network. \n\n     Rationale for implementation in the clinical setting.  The work proposed in this application is intentionally placed on the boundary of the efficacy-to-effectiveness transition102 in clinical trials.  We considered conducting a more traditional efficacy study, where participants would be invited to separate study visits for intervention delivery and measurements.  However, interventions that target improvements in diabetes self-management behaviors cannot be easily disarticulated from the clinical setting.  The hypothesized patient activation that may occur as a result of exposure to the digital storytelling intervention requires interaction with their healthcare home in order to translate that activation into improved outcomes.  Therefore, we pilot tested the intervention in primary care-based clinical settings.  We demonstrated feasibility of this approach while adapting intervention implementation for both sites.\n     \n     Mobile short message service.  Mobile short message service, i.e., text messaging, has been shown to have some impact on diabetes self-care104 and cardiovascular-related lifestyle105 behaviors. Furthermore, a Cochrane review suggested moderate evidence for increasing self-efficacy for diabetes self-management using mobile phone messaging106.  Therefore, to increase the likelihood that participants will watch the storytelling video several times during the intervention interval, participants will receive a monthly automated text message (five total) that asks them to self-rate their motivational level and self-efficacy for managing their T2D (0 = no motivation/self-confidence to 10 = extremely motivated/confident), and will recommend that they watch the storytelling intervention if they score lower than a 7.   \n     The rationale for the addition of mobile messages is that this intervention augmentation re-enforces concepts consistent with our theoretical framework.  It increases the potential treatment dose while maintaining an intervention package that is highly scalable.  As stated above, our pilot data indicate ubiquitous smart phone use among potential study participants.	36 months	6 months	None.	Aim #1: Evaluate the efficacy of a community-derived digital storytelling intervention among Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D.\n     The primary analysis will be an independent samples t-test between the group average hemoglobin A1c values at 3 months. A two-sided alternative with a 5% type I error rate will be employed.\n     \n     Supplementary analysis for the primary endpoint. Repeated measures modeling of the individual time point A1c values (including chart abstracted values at approximately 6 months) will allow for a more detailed investigation to the timing of the impact of the intervention by including all time points (including baseline). Profile analysis (Srivastava) will further assess for difference in overall means, time point, and treatment by time interactions. Covariates indicated above including demographics and clinical covariates will be included in the repeated measures and profile analysis models to assess the sensitivity of the primary analysis conditional on these potential concomitant (mediating) influences.\n     \nSecondary analyses. The analyses applied to the primary endpoint will also be applied to each of the secondary endpoints. The subscales from the SDSCA (general diet, diabetes diet, physical activity, diabetes medication use, blood glucose monitoring) and the physical measurements (blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, BMI) will be compared between groups using t-tests and repeated measures monitoring similar to the primary endpoint. As we have a single variable primary endpoint defined, there will be no adjustment for comparison-wise Type I error rate.  Additional analyses will be performed to identify potential effect modifiers for the primary and secondary outcomes, i.e., sex, age, socioeconomic position, acculturation, health literacy, and diabetes knowledge.\n     \nMissing Data. Our group has pioneered the use of sensitivity analysis and produced a macro which examines the stability of results by implementing 20 different imputation approaches for comparison including last value carried forward, mean, minimum, maximum value carried forward, simple single imputation, multiple imputation, nearest neighbor imputation and Bayesian methods. This macro will be applied to the primary and all key secondary endpoints (diabetes self-management behaviors, diabetes self-efficacy, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, BMI) and summarized by indicating the number of the methods producing different results. In our experience, with data that has fewer than 20% missing data, an average of more than 15 of the 20 methods produced the same experimental finding.\n\nAim #2:  Explore the effect of the digital storytelling intervention on proposed theory-based mediators of change.\n  We will examine the correlational structure of the covariates and their impact on the intervention effect size via repeated measures models. We will include procedures suggested by MacKinnon129,130 to assess mediation, fitting three general estimating equation models to the data.  We will first estimate the intervention effect separately for the dependent variable (with regression adjustment for covariates); that model provides an estimate of the total effect of the intervention.  Next, we will estimate the intervention effect for each mediator (with regression adjustment for covariates); that model provides an estimate of the effect of the intervention on the mediator.  Finally, we will estimate the mediated intervention effect for the dependent variable by adjusting for the mediator (and covariates); that model provides an estimate of the unmediated (i.e., direct) intervention effect, and the intervention-adjusted effect of the mediator on the dependent variable.  These analyses will be done for the primary endpoint and each of the secondary endpoints to identify any mediators of the study results.	First enrollment at both sites in March 2019.  We plan two years for enrollment.

Obesity and being overweight are important causal factors for several types of cancer, including those of the colorectum: convincing evidence indicates that obesity increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 50-100%.    The chronic, low-grade state of inflammation incited by obesity appears to have a major role in mediating the increased risk of colon cancer.  Although the inflammation produced by obesity has been known to exist in adipose tissue and serum for the past two decades, our recent publication was among the first to demonstrate that this heightened inflammatory state is also present in the colonic mucosa of obese laboratory animals.  Further, observations from a recent clinical study of ours (submitted) demonstrate for the first time that this inflammatory state also resides with the human colonic mucosa of obese individuals, and is accompanied by changes in the mucosal transcriptome that indicate upregulation of several pro-carcinogenic signaling pathways known to be activated by inflammation.      We postulate that this is an avenue by which obesity-associated inflammation increase colon cancer risk in humans and that blocking the downtream effects of this colonic inflammation will attenuate obesity-promoted cancer.  In this application we propose a clinical study using a novel combination of two inexpensive and safe anti-inflammatory agents: curcumin, a highly bioactive polyphenol in tumeric, and salsalate--a well-tolerated salicylate drug--to block obesity-induced colonic inflammation and the consequent risk of tumorigenesis.  Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that these two agents suppress inflammation by several pathways. By impeding multiple avenues leading to inflammation, we hypothesize that the two agents will produce a synergistic effect with minimal risk of toxicity, making the combination an excellent candidate for cancer-prevention. Our primary objective, therefore, is to determine within the context of a placebo-controlled trial whether the combination of these two agents will inhibit obesity-associated colonic inflammation, attenuate activation of pro-carcinogenic pathways, and suppress the altered mucosal cytokinetics that are thought to promote carcinogenesis.  By demonstrating salutory effects on these intermediary biomarkers, this trial will provide compelling rationale for a large scale human study for which cancer occurrence is the primary endpoint.	We will enroll 90 obese subjects (BMI > 30) at three study sites. Patients aged 45-75 yrs scheduled to undergo routine screening colonoscopy will be asked to participate. Recruitment will be conducted in a way to ensure that the proportion of genders within the two groups remain within 10% of each other. Patients will be considered ineligible if they have a current or previous cancer within the last 5 years (except basal cell cancer, superficial skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix), a history of inflammatory bowel disease, polyposis, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs >1X/week, oral corticosteroids or any other drugs considered by the investigators to likely to alter the inflammatory response.    Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive either two placebo tablets daily, or a 4 gram capsule of curcumin and 3.5 gram tablet of salsalate.    Twenty mLs of blood will be drawn before the colonoscopy for measurement of serum TNF-?, IL-1? and IL-6: these blood analytes constitute secondary endpoints.Weight, height, and waist and hip circumference of the subjects will also be measured immediately prior to colonoscopy.    Subjects will undergo routine colonoscopy, adenomas and other polyps will be removed per the usual clinical routine. We will record the number, size, and histological grade of all polyps, as well as any other pathologies.  Subjects will have 8 additional biopsies performed of the rectosigmoid junction, no closer than 10 cms to any polyp.  Collection of colonic biopsies is routine and in the four prior studies conducted by my research team in the colonoscopy suite, involving a total of over 140 subjects, and there has never been an adverse event.  Six of the biopsies will be placed immediately into a foil placket that is then inserted into a cryotube and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Colonic TNF-?, IL-1?, IL-6, and IF? concentrations, expressed in ng/mg mucosal protein, will be determined by our multiplex chemiluminescence platform and western blots will be used to quantitate cellular proteins indicative of NFkB and ERK 1/2 signaling. Each of the two remaining biopsies will be placed on a small piece of filter paper, oriented under a dissecting microscope located in the colonoscopy suite so the luminal surface of the mucosa is facing upwards, and fixed in buffered formalin.  Histology slides will be prepared, and quantitative immunohistochemistry will be used to assess Ki-67 and activated caspase-3, validated metrics of proliferation and apoptosis, respectively.     Four weeks later, after undergoing an identical colonic lavage preparation, each subject will undergo a colonoscopy limited to the rectosigmoid, at which time 8 biopsies will be obtained for the same endpoints.	Observations from our clinical study have demonstrated for the first time that obese humans harbor elevated levels of IL-1? and TNF-? in their colons.  Further, by comparing the colonic transcriptome from obese and leans subjects we have observed changes in gene expression that are indicative of activation of the NFkB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.  Activation of NFkB is thought to play a direct role in the molecular carcinogenesis of most colorectal cancers and ERK1/2 is an activator of ras, which is also thought to be integral in the evolution of colorectal cancer. We propose to conduct a Phase II placebo-controlled clinical trial that is designed to answer the following aims:    1) Determine if daily administration of the combination of curcumin and salsalate over 4 weeks diminishes the concentration of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in the colons of obese subjects undergoing routine screening colonoscopy, reduces valid measures of NFkB and ERK1/2 signaling, and alters metrics of epithelial proliferation and apoptosis in an anti-cancer direction.    2) Determine the incidence and define the nature of any side effects experienced by study subjects due to the co-administration of curcumin and salsalate.	The primary endpoint will be the measure of colonic IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha (other pro-inflammatory cytokines will also be measured as a matter of completeness). These analytes will be measured by a multiplex chemiluminescence platform that we have, and which was used successfully to measure human colonic cytokines in our prior clinical study.	1	We will enroll 90 obese subjects (BMI > 30). Patients aged 45-75 yrs who are scheduled to undergo routine screening colonoscopy in the Tufts Medical Center Endoscopy Suite and two other sites will be asked to participate. Recruitment will be conducted in a way to ensure that the proportion of genders within the two groups remain within 10% of each other. Patients will be considered ineligible if they have a current or previous cancer within the last 5 years (except basal cell cancer, superficial skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix), a history of inflammatory bowel disease, polyposis, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs >1X/week, oral corticosteroids or any other drugs considered by the investigators to likely to alter the inflammatory response.	Not provided	Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive either two placebo tablets daily, or a 4 gram capsule of curcumin and 3.5 gram tablet of salsalate.  After a 30 day intervention, this dose of curcumin was observed to produce a 40% decrease in colonic aberrant crypt foci among 19 human cigarette smokers (1).  Clinical trials with the same doses of these two agents have demonstrated few adverse effects.  No subject in the abovementioned curucmin trial (1) discontinued the curcumin due to adverse effects: the only grade 3 toxic event (i.e.: requiring hospitalization) was atypical chest pain, which was determined to be unrelated to the curcumin.  The grade 1 ('no or mild symptoms; no interventions required') and grade 2 ('minimal intervention indicated') events largely consisted of mild diarrhea.  In a 1 year placebo-controlled trial the abovementioned dose of salsalate was administered to 146 obese diabetics, who experienced significant decreases in systemic measures of inflammation and a significant improvement in blood glucose (2).  No serious adverse events were observed, including no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.  A very small but statistically significant increase in mean serum creatinine occurred in the salsalate group (0.02 mg/dL), which was significantly different than the placebo group, but neither the cystatin C or estimated GFR changed significantly.         1.

Not provided	Not provided	No conflicts to declare	Sample size estimates: Observations from our recent human study indicate the mean concentration of IL-1? in the colon of obese patients is 1.2 pg/mg protein, as compared to 0.65 in the lean group. Group sample sizes of 40 in each arm will achieve 80% power to detect a difference of 0.4 pg/mg between groups, assuming a mean of 1.2 pg/mg in the control group and that the mean of the intervention group is 0.8 with estimated group standard deviations of 0.8 and 0.3, and a significance level of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample t-test. Our preliminary data generated the above estimates of standard deviations in each group, and supports our detectable effect size. We plan to recruit 90 people in total, with equal allocation between the two treatment groups since this will accommodate a 5-10% loss to follow-up. Our sample size allows us to estimate an effect of curcumin/salsalate that is approximately two thirds of the size of the difference between mean IL1 beta levels in lean vs. obese human subjects.	A clinical trial coordinator, whose FTE effort will be no less than 40% on this trial, will be hired for each of the three study sites.  This coordinator will examine the colonoscopy schedule a few weeks in advance and telephone individuals who are likely candidates for the study.  The study will be briefly introduced and the coordinator will ask 2-3 questions to ensure that the prospective candidate meets the eligibility criteria.  If the prospect remains interested they will be met by the coordinator or P.I. on the morning of the colonoscopy.  At this time the study will be presented in detail and written consent will be obtained.  As mentioned in an earlier section, in our most recent study we were able to recruit six such obese subjects each month in the colonoscopy suite at Tufts Medical Center, which conducts about 25 colonoscopies per week.  With three sites actively recruiting, the study enrollment should be completed in 5-6 months.       The coordinator will accompany the subject into the colonoscopy suite, arrange for the blood sample with the endoscopy nurses, and remain during the endoscopy in order to receive and process the biopsies.      Two weeks into the intervention the coordinator will telephone subjects to monitor for any side effects of the intervention and to encourage compliance.  At the four week mark the coordinator will once again meet the subject in the colonoscopy suite to repeat sample collection.

15	2016-11-16	55	\N	\N	The IMMEDIATE-2 Trial: A Double-blinded Randomized Controlled Trial of Intravenous Glucose-Insulin-Potassium (GIK) for Acute Coronary Syndromes in Emergency Care	IMMEDIATE-2 Study	4	Completed in 2011, the IMMEDIATE (Immediate Myocardial Metabolic Enhancement During Initial Assessment and Treatment in Emergency Care) Trial was an NHLBI-supported clinical trial of emergency medical service (EMS) paramedic-administered intravenous glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (JAMA 2012;307(18):1925-1933, PMID 22452807). Differing from prior GIK trials in several respects, in the IMMEDIATE-2 trial GIK was given very early in the course of ACS, in communities, following 9-1-1 calls, rather than after hospitalization for documented acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  Although GIK did not significantly reduce the primary endpoint, progression to AMI, it did significantly reduce the composite endpoint of cardiac arrest or mortality - by 50% for those presenting with suspected ACS, and by 60% for those presenting with ST elevation AIM (STEMI).  Also, GIK reduced infarct size by 80%.     These were striking effects, but because the primary endpoint of progression to AMI was not positive, and the results differed dramatically from prior GIK trials, FDA felt that a confirmatory trial was needed.  Noting that the previous trials typically had given GIK on average six hours after ACS, rather than as it had worked in animal studies, very early in the course of ACS/AMI, also that none were double-blinded randomized controlled trials, another NIH-conducted randomized controlled trial was seen as being important, motivating undertaking an IMMEDIATE-2 Trial. Based on the fact that GIK treatment is inexpensive (a single treatment costing as little as $20), safe, and  easily administered, a demonstration of the effectiveness of GIK treatment in the IMMEDIATE-2 trial should lead to it's widespread adoption in the treatment of ACS.	IMMEDIATE-2 is proposed as a 1,485-participant randomized double-blind controlled trial of very early GIK for ACS with two cohorts: 1) an Accelerated Approval Path cohort of the first 900 participants, for whom hospital cardiac arrest, 30-day mortality, and infarct size will be collected, and 2) a Long-term Clinical Outcomes cohort of all 1,485, on whom one- and two-year mortality and hospitalization for heart failure (HF) will be assessed.     Participants would come from EMS settings, as in the original IMMEDIATE Trial, in addition to those getting very early treatment for suspected ACS in the emergency department (ED), to address the fact that half of all emergency patients with ACS do not come via EMS.  Besides providing more widely-applicable results, this should substantially expedite accrual compared to EMS-based enrollment alone.    Screening and Consent Procedures  EMS staff and/or ED physician will assess the patient using the ACI-TIPI predictive instruments to assist in the rapid and accurate identification of potential candidates for GIK and complete a screening form to determine a patient's eligibility if the 12-lead ECG shows at least one of the following:     A.    ACI-TIPI score of 75% or more    B.     TPI activated    C.     ECG shows a definitive acute MI with ST segment elevation based on local criteria    As per the initial IMMEDIATE trial, the IMMEDIATE -2 trial uses the 'exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research per 21CFR 50.24.      Statistical Analysis  The primary analytic group will be all those randomized to receive study drug as intent to treat (ITT), with a major secondary analytic group being a modified ITT (MITT) group, which includes all those who were randomized and were also continued on study drug for presumed ACS following ED evaluation.  Additionally, an analysis will be done on all those participants who presented with STEMI.    The primary endpoint for the Accelerated Approval cohort is a three step composite of 1) all-cause mortality, 2) cardiac arrest, and 3) infarct size, using a Finkelstein-Schoenfeld sequence, on which we have worked with FDA.  Of note, whereas to detect a 25% reduction in an endpoint of only all-cause mortality, 15,450 participants would be needed, and for a composite endpoint of mortality or cardiac arrest, for which 6,600 would be needed, when using a Finkelstein-Schoenfeld sequence of mortality, cardiac arrest, and infarct size, only 900 participants would be needed.  This should result in a faster and far less expensive trial, and is planned for the Accelerated Approval cohort. Specifically, the sample size estimation for the Accelerated Approval cohort is based on a simulation for the sequential composite endpoint, looking for statistical power to detect a 25% reduction, using the following rates based on the placebo events in the original IMMEDIATE Trial:  mortality, 6% vs. 4.5%; cardiac arrest 3% vs. 1.5%; and infarct size means of 8% vs. 4% of left ventricular mass.     For the Long-term Clinical Outcomes cohort, the calculation of sample size needed to detect a difference in HF hospitalization or death over two years is based on an event rate at one-year of 16% (control) vs. 12% (GIK), an event ratio of 0.75.  This results in a need for a total of 1,485 participants (743 per group) to have 90% power to compare Kaplan-Meier curves using a log-rank test.  Based on these projections, we envision a two-year enrollment period with two years of follow-up at approximately 25 ED/EMS sites.	The objective of this study is to test the impact of pharmacological myocardial metabolic support, in the form of intravenous (IV) glucose, insulin and potassium (GIK), for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and unstable angina pectoris (UAP). The primary hypothesis is that immediate GIK will have a beneficial effect on the incidence of all cause-mortality, in-hospital cardiac arrest and infarct size at 30 days. In addition, immediate GIK will improve long term clinical outcomes by reducing the incidence of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure at 1 year and 2 years.	The primary endpoint for the Accelerated Approval cohort will be a three-step composite of all-cause mortality, cardiac arrest, and infarct size, using a Finkelstein-Schoenfeld sequence. Additional detailed on this are provided in the study design section.    The primary endpoint for the Long Term Clinical Follow Up is the combination of in-hospital cardiac arrest, hospitalization for heart failure and all cause mortality at 1 year and 2 years.	1	Inclusion Criteria  1.

After injury, Schwann cells become "repair cells" releasing a host of\ngrowth factors and other repair facilitating proteins. We hypothesize that the "repair cell" properties of\nSchwann cells triggered by activation of the c-Jun pathway, which increases production of many repair\nfactors and neurotrophic factors such as BDNF, GDNF, NT-3 and NGF from a patient's sural nerve, may\nhelp slow the degeneration and/or restore function in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra\n(SN). To date, we have employed an adaptive design to carry out open label Phase I clinical trials where we\nhave implanted grafts (~ 5 pieces of sural nerve) into the SN of 37 participants. Initially, we implanted to a single\ntarget, unilaterally in 8 participants. Next, we implanted 18 participants. Subsequently, we have escalated the\ndose in 11 participants by progressing from two targets in the unilateral SN, to two targets in one SN plus one\ntarget in the contralateral SN, and finally two targets to each SN. We now propose to proceed with a doubleblinded,\nrandomized Phase IIa clinical trial to determine clinical efficacy of peripheral nerve grafts\nimplanted into the SN. Study participants (n=36) diagnosed with PD who have selected for, qualified for,\nand agreed to DBS of the GPi will be part of a blinded clinical trial and receive bilateral, dual-target\nautologous sural nerve grafts (20 pieces total) implanted into the SN or receive only nerve biopsy\n(randomized, blinded control group) during the GPi DBS surgery. Efficacy measures will be the primary\nendpoint of a clinically important improvement (≥ 5 points) based on MDS-UPDRS III evaluation at 24 months\nafter surgery compared to baseline. Secondary endpoint evaluations include evaluation of the safety and\ntolerability of multi-target sural graft deployments to the SN, activities of daily living and quality of life. Exploratory\nanalysis of gait and imaging studies to determine the in vivo effects of the sural nerve grafts by using MRI and\nDaTscan® SPECT imaging carried out at 0 and 24 months post-surgery. This trial should contribute to a better\nunderstanding of ways to improve the function of dopaminergic circuitry and push the development of disease\nmodifying therapies in PD.	 Single center, double-blind, randomized, parallel design\n Phase IIa\n Two arm: Experimental arm: Graft delivery to SN.

474	2019-03-11	20	\N	t	Does dietary fiber enhance re-establishment of the gut microbiome composition following antibiotic therapy?	Antibiotic Microbiome Study	6	Antibiotics greatly disturb the gut microbiome. We have proposed a pilot dietary intervention study comprised of approximately 10 - 15 adults diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection and prescribed antibiotics. We will conduct a randomized controlled intervention spanning approximately 5 months in which in which participants will be randomized to consume 10g of prebiotic fiber powder or a placebo following an antibiotic course. We will analyze how and when the microbiome returns to its original state (prior to antibiotic usage). Further, we will analyze whether consumption of prebiotic fiber enhances re-establishment of the microbiome to its original state. We hypothesize that prebiotic fiber consumed during antibiotic therapy enhances re-establishment of the gut microbiome following exposure to antibiotics and  that re-establishment of microbiome composition is at least partially governed by the DNA methylome.	We will to conduct a randomized controlled intervention study, which will span approximately 5 months. Individuals prescribed antibiotics by a clinician will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: prebiotic or placebo. Participants will consume 10g of prebiotic fiber powder (Inulin, NOW Foods) or placebo (rice flour, Bob's Red Mill), dissolved in a glass of juice, daily for 5 months following the antibiotic treatment. Participants and investigators will be blinded to which powder they are receiving. Fecal samples and/or anal swabs will be collected at baseline, after completion of the antibiotic therapy, and at months 1, 3, and 5 months after completion of antibiotic treatment.	The specific aims of this study are as follows: \n\nI.\tTo assess the impact of prebiotic fiber consumed during antibiotic therapy on re-establishment of the gut microbiome following exposure to antibiotics.\nII.\tTo assess whether re-establishment of microbiome composition is at least partially governed by the DNA methylome.	The primary endpoints of this study are as follows: \na) bacterial relative abundance before and after antibiotic therapy at the taxa level\nb) total microbial diversity (alpha diversity) \nc) shifts in alpha diversity and the relative abundances of bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria).	1	Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: We will recruit approximately 10 - 15 adults (men and women, aged 18 - 45 years), diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection and prescribed antibiotics. We will recruit adults prescribed oral erythromycin (macrolide class). We will consider a range of oral capsules and tablets of erythromycin (Base: 250-500 mg every 6-12 hours 4 g daily; Ethylsuccinate: 400-800 mg every 6-12 hours with max 4 g daily).\n \t\nAdditional exclusion criteria include: antibiotic use or upper respiratory infection within 5 months of the study start date, hospitalization within 30 days, residence in a long-term medical facility, renal translplant or renal replacement therapy, allergic reactions to the antibiotic listed above, regular dietary supplement usage, regular pro- and/or prebiotic usage, pregnancy, patients with any chronic medical illnesses, patients on medications other than contraceptives, patients who smoke or use tobacco regularly, female patients who are menopausal, and patients with dietary restrictions.	We have previously partnered with the UCLA Ashe Clinic to distribute study flyers. \n\nFor the purposes of this application, the planned participating site includes UCLA.	The study intervention is a prebiotic fiber powder (Inulin, from NOW foods) consumed orally. Participants will consume approximately 10g per day.	Estimated study time is ten months from enrollment to study end.	Individual participants will conclude their participation after five months.	\N	\N	We will enroll participants on a rolling basis, so as not to interfere with their scheduled antibiotic treatment. Currently, we have distributed study flyers at trafficked locations around the UCLA campus. We have also left flyers at the Ashe clinic and pharmacy. Interested persons should use the contact information on the flyer to reach out to the study team for screening. To date, the flyers have been up for approximately 3 months with little interest. No participants have been enrolled.

Lactoferrin Study in ELBW Infants	3	Hypothesis: Lactoferrin supplementation will prevent late-onset BSIs and NEC in extremely low birth weight infants.\nTo study the safety and efficacy of lactoferrin, we will perform a multicenter prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in 284 preterm infants <1000 grams and <8 days old admitted to six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).  Groups will receive study treatment enterally  (300 mg/kg/day of bovine lactoferrin or placebo-sterile water) from enrollment until 40 weeks postmenstrual age, discharge/transfer or death.	We will conduct a Phase 2B multicenter prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bovine lactoferrin supplementation for the prevention of late-onset BSIs and NEC in 284 preterm infants admitted to six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).  Groups will receive study treatment enterally  (300 mg/kg/day of bovine lactoferrin or placebo-sterile water) from enrollment until 40 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), discharge/transfer or death.  Randomization will be done as permuted blocks, with randomly chosen block sizes of 2 or 4.  Randomization will be stratified by site, with separate randomization occurring within each of the 6 sites.	Aim 1.  To study the safety and efficacy of lactoferrin, we will perform a multicenter prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in 284 preterm infants <1000 grams and <8 days old admitted to six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) under strict FDA guideline and an IND.  Groups will receive study treatment (300 mg/kg/day of bovine lactoferrin or placebo-sterile water) with feedings twice a day from enrollment until 40 weeks PMA, discharge/transfer or death. Primary endpoint for the study will be BSI or NEC after 3 days of age while receiving study treatment.  Safety will be assessed throughout the study and post discharge parent surveys of infant feeding type (human milk, formula type, and cow's milk) during the first two years.  Lactoferrin levels will be measured in saliva, scavenged blood samples, and in maternal or donor breast milk when on full enteral feeding volumes for one week around week 3-4.   \n\nThe sample size is based on a two-sided type I error rate of 0.05 and 80 percent power, using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, to detect an absolute difference of 50 percent in the cumulative incidence of BSI or NEC between groups based on 2016 Vermont Oxford Network (VON) data on incidence of late-onset infections of 23% and NEC of 10%.  \n\nAim 2.  To examine the effects of lactoferrin on postnatal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) acquisition. Fresh human milk is the preferred diet for this preterm population, but carries the risk of postnatal CMV acquisition. Saliva samples will be performed prior to and at the end of study solution administration.  Postnatal CMV acquisition will be determined by detection of CMV in saliva by qPCR using a previously established dried saliva swab qPCR method and then compared between lactoferrin and placebo groups\n\nAim 3.  To investigate the effects of lactoferrin on growth and development. Growth during study solution administration and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age will be assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II).  VABS-II is a skill-based measure that is well validated in preterm infants and has been used in other neonatal multicenter trails.  It can be performed in person or by phone facilitating and increasing the number of patients we obtain long term follow up. This is critical as many patients may be outborn or live close to their NICU's institution.   \n\nAim 4.  To examine the effects of lactoferrin on the stool microbiome. The effects of lactoferrin on the stool microbiome is lacking and may play a role in its effectiveness.  Stool samples will be collected when infants are tolerating full enteral feedings (>120 ml/kg/day and off antibiotics for 7 days), and will be compared between groups for diversity and dysbiosis using standard 16s rRNA sequencing.  \n\n\nPrimary endpoint for the study will be BSI or NEC (Stage 2 or greater)  after 3 days of age while receiving study treatment.  \nSecondary endpoints: \n-Urinary tract infections\n-Skin and soft tissue infections\n-Antibiotic days\n-CMV acquisition\n-Microbiome\n\n-Growth\n-Days to full enteral feedings\n\n-Length of stay\n-Hospital costs\n\n-Neurodevelopmental outcome\n-Mortality	Primary endpoint: \n-BSI or NEC (Stage 2 or greater)  after 3 days of age while receiving study treatment.  \n\nSecondary endpoints: \n-Urinary tract infections\n-Skin and soft tissue infections\n-Antibiotic days\n-CMV postnatal acquisition\n-Effect on microbiome\n\n-Growth\n-Days to full enteral feedings\n\n-Length of stay\n-Hospital costs\n\n-Neurodevelopmental outcome\n-Mortality	2	Inclusion criteria:\n-Preterm infants (<32 weeks) admitted to the NICU\n-Less than or equal to 7 days old \n-Birth weight less than 1000 grams\nExclusion criteria:\n-NEC, bowel perforation, congenital bowel disorders, or bowel obstruction\n-Congenital anomalies or other conditions that may limit advancing to full enteral feedings (e.g. left sided congenital heart diseases and coarctation).	We have assembled 6 centers in the United States with experience and expertise as clinical sites for multicenter trials. All sites are well versed in running clinical trials, with experienced local principal investigators, clinical research coordinators and investigational pharmacists.  There are a total of 400 ELBWs born each year at the 6 centers, with a conservative estimated consent and enrollment rate of 33% we should be able to enroll 133 infants a year when all sites have IRB approval and are enrolling facilitating enrollment over 2.5-3 years.  \n\nThe 6 sites include: \nDuke University, Durham, North Carolina\nUniversity of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA\nVanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee\nOregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon\nAlbert Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA\nRush University Medical Center, Chicago IL	We will conduct a multicenter prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in 284 preterm infants admitted to six neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the United States.  The study will be performed under an Investigation New Drug (IND) application.  Prior to enrollment, written informed consent will be obtained from each infant's parent or guardian. The protocol will be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each hospital or a central IRB. We will enroll 142 infants in the lactoferrin group (300 mg/kg daily dosing) and 142 in the placebo group. Study solution (lactoferrin or placebo) will be given enterally by a feeding tube or by mouth depending how each infant is feeding. Groups will receive treatment from enrollment until 40 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA), discharge, transfer or death.\n\nLactoferrin (BioFerrin2000) will be provided for the study by Glanbia Nutritionals with additional quality control testing performed on each lot for microbial and endotoxin content prior to lot use.  Lactoferrin study solution will be prepared under aseptic conditions in each participant center's pharmacy by adding sterile water to dry lactoferrin powder.  Placebo will be an equivalent volume of sterile water alone. To prevent any contamination during compounding, the study solution will be prepared aseptically using sterile containers and syringes by investigational pharmacists at each site. Infants will be assessed for an issues following administration. Each infant will receive the study solution just prior to the scheduled feeding of expressed breast milk, donor milk or formula if feeding, or given alone if not feeding.	There are a total of 400 ELBWs born each year at the 6 centers, with a conservative estimated consent and enrollment rate of 33% we should be able to enroll 133 infants a year when all sites have IRB approval and are enrolling facilitating enrollment over 2.5-3 years for aims 1, 2 and 3.  The secondary outcome of long term neurodevelopmental follow up will be completed 2 years after last enrolled patient reaches 40 weeks PMA.  \n\nNeurodevelopmental status will be evaluated at 2 years of life using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II).  VABS-II is a skill-based measure that is well validated in preterm infants and has been used in other multicenter trails evaluating infection related outcomes.  We also have experience using this in other clinical trials.  It can be done in person or by phone facilitating and increasing the number of patients we obtain long term follow up. This is critical as many patients will be outborn and/or do not live close to their NICU's institution.	Groups will receive treatment from enrollment until 40 weeks PMA, discharge, transfer or death.  For each individual patient, in hospital participation will last approximately 3 to 4 months depending on their gestational age and age at discharge for primary outcome. Long term follow up will be up to 2 years corrected age (~2 years 3-4 months).	No conflicts of interest or financial disclosures.	Analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes.  The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, with site defining the strata, will be used to compare the primary outcome, cumulative incidence of BSI or NEC (Stage 2 or greater)  between the groups.   Subsequent analyses will use logistic regression to compare the groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics of the patients.  Similar analyses will be done for the incidence of urinary tract, skin or soft tissue infections or mortality.  Lactoferrin levels will be compared factoring in the effects of feeding type and infection.  Standard two-sample nonparametric tests will be used to compare the secondary outcomes of days until full enteral feeding, length of stay and hospital costs.  Repeated measures analyses will be used to compare growth over time between the groups.  \n\nInterim analyses. We plan for interim analyses after 25%, 50%, and 75% of patients have been observed on the primary outcome.  The initial interim analysis is primarily to check for data acquisition and accrual issues.  At the 50% and 75% interim analyses, formal tests for efficacy will be presented to the DSMB.  Guidelines for early stopping for efficacy or futility will be derived from the Lan-Demets alpha-1 spending function and conditional power calculations.	There are a total of 400 ELBWs born each year at the 6 centers, with a conservative estimated consent and enrollment rate of 33-40% we should be able to enroll 133-160 infants a year when all sites have IRB approval and are enrolling facilitating enrollment over 2-2.5 years.  Families will be approached if their infant is admitted to the NICU and <8 days of age.  At UVA in our Phase I study  performed last year over 9 months, we screened 39 patients who were <1000 grams and 14 consented (40% enrollment rate) and where enrolled in the study.  Extrapolation of a 12-month period would yield 20 patients per year of RND at UVA of 1.6.  Depending on each site, enrollment will average between15-30 patients a year, translating into an RND/site per month of 1.25 to 2.5 patients.  \n\nAs the University of Virginia has performed a phase 1 safety study of 31 patients, they will likely be the first center started following funding and after the lot of bovine lactoferrin meets prescreening microbial and endotoxin testing criteria.  All sites should be enrolling within 4-6 months of study activation.  From the phase 1 study, 31 patients <1500 grams where enrolled over 9 months, with half of them being <1000 grams, so approximately 20 of 50 infants <1000 grams or 40% per year consented and enrolled.  \n\nCurrently we have 6 centers, increasing center number would increase enrollment rates leading to meeting enrollment goals sooner and having study results sooner in this important area of infection prevention.

Dapagliflozin is a member of a new class of diabetes drugs, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.  These drugs inhibit glucose re-uptake in the kidney, but there are several other proposed mechanisms of action.  Empagliflozin and canagliflozin have both reported a reduction in cardiovascular events among diabetic patients.  Empagliflozin was associated with a marked reduction in cardiovascular death and heart failure admissions.  There are also appear to be benefits in terms of preserved renal function over time in diabetics.  As such, several trials are underway to test the efficacy of these drugs in patients with established heart failure.  Many of the proposed mechanisms of action are pertinent to the patients with aortic stenosis and heart failure who have undergone TAVR.	42-48 months	Treatment and Visits\n\tTreatment: Dapagliflozin 10mg daily versus matching placebo (randomized and administered orally in double blind fashion).\n\tStudy duration: 1 year\n\tStudy visits (in-person):\n\t•   Screening (after TAVR while still in the hospital)\n\t•   Randomization / baseline (after TAVR while still in the hospital just prior to discharge)\n\t•   30 days\n\t•   6 months\n\t•   1 year\n\t\n\tStudy phone calls:\n\t•   2 days\n\t•   10 days\n\t•   3 months\n\t•   9 months	None related to dapagliflozin.

Statistical Analysis Background (Frank Harrell, PhD) -- see proposal for more detail, including tables\nA binary endpoint in a clinical trial is a minimum-information endpoint that yields the lowest power for treatment comparisons. A time-to-event outcome has little power gain over a pure binary endpoint, since its power comes from the number of events (number of uncensored observations). The highest power endpoint would be from a continuous variable that is measured precisely and reflects the clinical outcome situation. An ordinal outcome with, say, five or more well-populated levels yields power that can approach that of a truly continuous outcome. When the original binary outcome represents the union of several clinical endpoints, the analysis treats all endpoints as equally important. An ordinal outcome variable, even if it has only a few levels, breaks the ties and improves power. When there are clinical responses that are ordinal or continuous and one is willing to assume that any clinical event overrides any level of such a scale, one can easily construct an ordinal scale that incorporates both clinical events and the scale. A great advantage of this approach, besides improved power, is that it gives one a place to record bad clinical events such as death, without the need for using a complex statistical analysis that has to deal with such questions as "what would have happened had the patient not died" or "how do I handle missing data when the patient died before the ordinal/continuous was measured?".\n\nContinuous and ordinal scales can be compared between treatment groups using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two-sample test. This does not allow for adjustment of covariates, nor does it properly handle a large number of ties in the patient responses. The proportional odds (PO) ordinal logistic regression model is a generalization of the Wilcoxon test, and it handles arbitrarily heavy ties. We will use the PO model in what follows. For now we consider the oversimplified situation in which a patient has recorded the worst category outcome that occurred within 12 months of randomization. For the actual clinical trial analysis we will use a GEE-like approach in which the ordinal outcome scale is assessed weekly until the patient dies or follow-up ends. This approach counts multiple hospitalizations as having more weight than a single hospitalization. Within-patient correlation will be accounted for using a cluster sandwich covariance estimator. Since the power calculations below use only one overall measurement per patient, it represents a lower bound on the power that will actually be obtained. The power formula used here is due to Whitehead using the R Hmisc package function popower or by simulation using the simRegOrd function.\n\nThe proportional odds model handles treatment effects through odds ratios. Let the ordinal outcome be denoted by Y and one of its levels be y. Consider the probability that Y ≥ y for a patient on treatment A and for a patient on treatment B. The odds that Y ≥ y for a treatment is the probability divided by one minus the probability. The B : A odds ratio for Y ≥ y is some constant OR and by the PO assumption this OR is the same no matter which cutoff y is chosen. When the hard clinical events are at the high end of the ordinal scale and a patient oriented outcome scale is at the low end, the PO model assumes that the treatment effect (on the OR scale) for, say, death is the same as the OR for the outcome scale being worse than any given level or the patient dying. When the treatment has a different effect on nonfatal outcomes as for fatal ones, the overall OR represents a kind of weighted average over the various treatment effects.\n\nSample Size Calculation\nAs outlined in detail [http://data.vanderbilt.edu/fh/attach/power.html - see sections "Background", "BNP as an Outcome", and "References"], the primary endpoint will be analyzed as a proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model.  We reviewed the literature, including several TAVR trials and multiple national registries, to estimate the anticipated event probabilities for components of our primary endpoint.  These ranges are shown below (Table 1).\n\nFrank Harrell, PhD, performed multiple simulations to determine power based on different (1) sample sizes and (2) different event rates.  The estimates in Table 2 below assume an odds ratio of 0.75 for the clinical events in the composite and assume a fold change of 0.75 in the final NTproBNP (25% reduction in median).  The lower and higher event rates are shown above.  Estimates are shown both including and excluding worsening heart failure as a component of the primary endpoint. \n\nNote that unlike the case where there is a single binary or ordinal endpoint, the combined ordinal endpoint has higher power when the overriding clinical events have lower incidence.  This is because lower incidence implies that more of the overall endpoint would be coming from the more high-powered continuous NTproBNP outcome.  However, the trade-off is that fewer events means that the primary endpoint is more of a biomarker (surrogate) endpoint and less of a "clinical" endpoint.  We want to strike the right balance, namely including "enough" clinical events to make it really be a clinical primary endpoint, while also being conscious of sample size and cost implications.  We propose a sample size of 350 subjects (175 in each arm).  It is important to note that these are conservative estimates of power in that for the actual clinical trial analysis we will use a GEE-like approach in which the ordinal outcome scale is assessed weekly until the patient dies or follow-up ends.  This approach counts multiple hospitalizations and worsening heart failure events as having more weight than a single event and also allows for the assessment of NTproBNP at 4 study time points.  Collectively, this mitigates the impact that drop-outs or subjects lost to follow-up have on the analysis in that they are all still included for some period of the study.  The simulations also assume no correlation between events and final NTproBNP value, which is actually unlikely to be true; a correlation between events and NTproBNP values will increase power.	The following projections are made assuming that Astra Zeneca gives funding support and the Trial Innovation Network agrees to support/coordinate this study in early January 2018 -- since it will likely be a little later, the timelines will be pushed back some.  Nonetheless, this addresses most of the questions above.  The PI has an established relationship and collaborations with investigators at many leading TAVR centers across the United States.  Those established relationships will be leveraged in identifying enrolling sites.  We will also not have to actively recruit for this trial in that centers will simply seek to enroll subjects undergoing TAVR at their site (potential subjects will be coming to them).  Most of the centers to be included will perform 150-400 TAVRs per year and the vast majority of subjects (approximately 60-80%) will be candidates for this trial.\n* Begin contact with potential sites (surveys, conversations, etc.) -- March 1, 2018\n* FDA IND exemption obtained -- March 30, 2018\n* Finish final protocol - April 30, 2018\n* Sub-agreement between VUMC and sites drafted -- May 31, 2018\n* Official reach out to potential sites begins -- June 1, 2018\n* Central IRB approval -- June 30, 2018\n* Enrolling 1st patient at VUMC -- August 1, 2018\n* Site initiation completed for first 5 sites (5 center enrolling) -- October 1, 2018\n* Site initiation completed for next 10 sites (15 centers enrolling) -- January 1, 2019\n* Site initiation completed for final 10 sites (25 centers enrolling) -- March 1, 2019\n* Enrollment of 50 -- March 30, 2019\n* Enrollment of 100 -- July 30, 2019\n* Enrollment of 150 -- October 30, 2019\n* Enrollment of 200 -- January 31, 2020\n* Enrollment of 250 -- May 31, 2020\n* Enrollment of 300 -- August 31, 2020\n* Trial enrollment completed (350) -- December 31, 2020\n* Final follow-up completed -- December 31, 2021\n* Data cleaning finished and data locked -- April 30, 2022\n* Primary analysis complete -- August, 2022 (to be presented at ESC)

Traditional approaches to developing therapies have failed in ALS, yielding only a single FDA approved therapy with a modest benefit on survival(8).  Thus, there is a pressing need for new therapeutic approaches in ALS.  One such approach used to treat cancer and HIV has been drug combinations targeting different pathological pathways.  Many currently available drugs directed at the diverse ALS pathological mechanisms have shown promise in cell lines, animal models, or yielded indeterminate results in small, often underpowered human clinical trials(18).  Hypothesis: Using combination drug therapies targeting different pathological pathways may be more effective than the current standard of care (SOC) in slowing progression of ALS and will have a direct and immediate impact on patient care. Primary Aim: to determine which of three drug combinations has the greatest effect on slowing disease progression in ALS. Secondary aims: to determine the tolerability of drug combination therapies and their effect on respiratory decline in ALS, and rates of decline using a patient-derived functional rating scale. Our primary outcome is the change in the slope of decline of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R).  Secondary outcomes include adverse event reporting, respiratory function, a global impression of change questionnaire, and a patient-derived revision of the ALSFRS (ALSFRS-DEMAND).	This is an open-label 3 arm design of nmax =300 patients using a Bayesian Adaptive Design for randomization.	New translational science tools and approaches for more rapidly advancing health research to the common goal of improved cures and treatments are especially needed for studies of rare diseases.  The goals of this application are 1) to create a model for leveraging existing national research initiatives and new translational science tools to build the infrastructure to run multi-site studies in rare diseases; and 2) for proof of concept, to use this CTSA-based national research infrastructure to test the hypothesis that drug combination therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) will be more effective than standard of care alone. ALS is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disease which is uniformly fatal.  Traditional approaches to developing therapies have failed in ALS, yielding only a single FDA approved therapy with a modest benefit on survival.  Thus, there is a pressing need for new therapeutic approaches in ALS. One such approach used to treat cancer and HIV has been drug combinations targeting different pathological pathways.  We convened an ALS patient and caregiver focus group who expressed overwhelming interest in using a drug 'cocktail' approach to ALS therapy. Patients also frequently state they feel left out or abandoned once their disease progresses beyond the earliest stages, the most common focus of most ALS clinical trials. Therefore, we designed a patient-driven clinical trial to assess which of three drug cocktails targeting different pathological pathways are the most effective in slowing disease progression in ALS: the ALS Patient-Driven Electronic-based Multidrug Adaptive Network Design clinical trial (ALS PATIENTs DEMAND). For ALS PATIENTs DEMAND we will leverage existing major initiatives to simplify the regulatory process, to connect electronic health records (EHRs) of large academic ALS centers, and to roll out common data elements through the EHR and via CTSA funded REDCap databases to build a large national ALS clinical trial network-providing the bandwidth to study large numbers of ALS patients, and importantly, to broaden study inclusion criteria to include ALS patients often excluded from traditional clinical trials.    Aim 1: To leverage existing research initiatives and introduce new innovations to streamline regulatory oversight, ensure meaningful patient-engagement, enhance recruitment, decrease the burden of outcome collection, and hasten results dissemination using 3 CTSA Coordinating Centers and 25 sites (20 CTSAs).  Specifically:    a.         We will compare the regulatory efficiencies across 3 different networks: two IRB reliance models (Greater Plains Collaborative: a PCORNet CDRN; and the University of California Regulatory System); and one central IRB (the ALS Rare Disease Clinical Research Network).  We will compare the time to regulatory approval, time from regulatory approval to first patient enrollment, and rates of accrual.    b.         We will create a patient engagement plan which incorporates the patient voice into all aspects of the clinical trial: protocol development, recruitment, retention, study conduct, and dissemination of results.    c.         We will use EHR-defined computable phenotypes for patient screening, and compare this approach to traditional recruitment strategies in the clinic or via patient advocacy groups.    d.         We will leverage the availability of EPIC downloadable ALS clinic templates for the primary set of outcomes to compare outcomes collected by this EHR-i2b2 interface with those collected by using REDCap database links within the local clinic work-flow. We also will explore whether this approach reduces the burden on patients, caregivers, and health care providers.    e.         We will implement a patient visit and adverse event monitoring system via a two way web-based video system already in production to reduce the burden of participation and ensure retention.    Aim 2: To determine which of three drug regimens added to standard of care has the greatest efficacy for slowing ALS disease progression.  For this aim we will conduct a prospective 12 month three-arm Bayesian response adaptive randomization clinical trial. Drug combinations will repurpose FDA approved drugs for other indications which act on potential ALS pathological pathways (neuroinflammation, motor neuron hyperexcitability, and glutamate excitotoxicity). Informative priors and stopping criteria will be derived from the PROACT data base of 8500 patients.  The diverse ALS population in our national ALS network (over 4700 patients) and the informative priors derived from PROACT will allow us to broaden our inclusion criteria to include patients often excluded from current clinical trials.    Our proposed collaboration among CTSA coordinating centers to create a model for assembling study-specific infrastructure for rare diseases will not only serve as a blueprint for future clinical trials in ALS, but also will inform any multi-center clinical trials seeking to more efficiently maximize network-level collaboration to study any disease.	Functional status is the primary outcome.  The ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) was designed to assess the ability of ALS patients to perform activities of daily living and to detect functional changes during clinical trials(52). Precedent for using this scale in clinical trials stems from the only positive treatment trial of riluzole in ALS, which showed slower decline in treated patients relative to placebo(53, 54).  The ALSFRS-R, a revised version of the ALSFRS, is a quickly administered, by research personnel or study staff (five minutes), ordinal rating scale that assesses capability and independence in 12 functional activities. These include six bulbar-respiratory functions, three upper extremity functions (writing, cutting food, and dressing), and three gross motor functions (walking, climbing, and turning in bed). Each activity is recorded to the closest approximation from a list of five choices, scored 0-4, with the total score ranging from 48 (normal function) to 0 (no function).  The ALSFRS-R has been used extensively in previous clinical trials and validity has been established by correlating ALSFRS-R scores with quantitative strength testing and changes in strength over time (55-63).    For this project we further revised the ALSFRS-R and created the ALSFRS-DEMAND. We modified the ALSFRS-R so that it would be patient user friendly and so patients could fill it out themselves. The ALSFRS- R was sent to approximately 20 ALS patients throughout the GPC region and their caregivers. They were asked if the scale was difficult to understand; if there were items they felt should be dropped from the ALSFRS-R; or if new items should be included. We held two focus group conference calls where the patients discussed and commented on the scale. Patient focus group recommendations included a need for clarification in meanings of some of the words in the ALSFRS-R, but overall the impression was that this instrument reflected the types of functional limitations they experienced on a daily basis. However, there also were several items patients believed should be added to the ALSFRS-R: a question about pain; a question about emotional liability; and a general non-denominational question about faith. These were added and our new ALSFRS-DEMAND survey is designed to be completed by patients between clinic visits and can be completed via the EHR patient portal or an individualized email link to a REDCap database.    Currently riluzole is the only approved medication for patients with ALS, which extends life by only 2-3 months. If any of the drug combinations proposed here proves effective in ALS, this will have a dramatic and immediate impact on patients, their family members, and communities.  All of the proposed drug combinations are readily accessible, registered FDA medications used for other indications, and should be available in generic formulations by the end of the study.  It would be expected most ALS patients interested could obtain access to the proposed treatments, and so benefit. In addition, if the study design innovations proposed here prove feasible this also may transform the way we approach therapies in ALS.	1	Patient characteristics: Clinical trials of experimental interventions in ALS use narrow inclusion criteria which exclude most ALS patients by limiting studies to patients with symptom onset within 2 years, and FVC >75% predicted.  This excludes more than half of patients who will have FVC < 75% predicted at diagnosis(25).  In focus groups, patients and their family members made it clear they find this approach makes them feel left out of studies of new or promising therapies. They suggested a more reasonable approach for inclusion would be by baseline functional status. Therefore, our inclusion criteria will be:  a) A clinical diagnosis by a study investigator of ALS; and b) ALSFRS-R ? 20 (moderately affected); and our exclusion criteria will be: a) Any medication contra-indications for the particular drugs being studied; b) inability to provide informed consent; and c) current pregnancy or lactation.	The 25 sites included here serve > 4,700 ALS patients.	Each arm of the study will consist of standard of care (SOC) as detailed in the AAN Guidelines (access to riluzole, PEG for nutrition, and NIV as indicated) plus one of three drug combinations:(10)    1) tamoxifen (20 mg: 2 times/day) and memantine (20 mg: 2 times/day);    2) tamoxifen (20 mg: 2 times/day) and mexiletine (200 mg: 3 times/day); and    3) tamoxifen (20 mg: 2 times/day) and ranolazine (500 mg: 2 times/day).    The drug interactions for the proposed study arms were reviewed by a consulting pharmacist PhD.	Not provided	Not provided	There is no significant financial interest or potential conflict that might be related to the proposal.	We can vastly improve the efficiency of our study by using an adaptive Bayesian study design, informative priors and interval analyses to adapt randomization during the study to favor drug combinations which interval analyses suggest are beneficial. Informative priors can be drawn from The Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials data base (PRO-ACT), the largest database ever created of clinical data on ALS patients.  PRO-ACT contains over 8500 fully de-identified clinical patient records, and more than 8 million longitudinally collected data points. Patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms (groups) with a maximum number of patient's nmax= 300 (see Protocol Synopsis for specific power calculations and modeling). The primary endpoint used to drive adaptive randomization and stopping criteria is: the average disease progression (monthly measures of ALSFRS-R) from enrollment to 52 weeks. A longitudinal model using early estimates from 26 weeks will allow early adaptive randomization to promote a smaller, faster, but more powerful trial.  Interim analysis will occur after 100 patients have 52 week data and every 8 weeks thereafter.  These data will inform an updated adaptive randomization schedule. We will 'stop for success' if the probability a treatment is best is > .965. For interim analyses, all data are used on all enrolled patients with at least 26 weeks of data. For the final analysis: (1) a treatment is best if pr(it is best) > .95 or (2) a treatment is loser if pr(it is best) < .01. It was deemed the most likely effect size will be a disease progression of 1 point/month for usual care, but only 0.75 point/month for the best drug combination (an effect size greater than current SOC)(8) . For example, in the 'One Best' case, the study design has 94% power to find the best treatment with an estimated 238 subjects, trial duration of 135 weeks, and 47% of the subjects in the winning group. Type I error rate is 5%. A pre-specified subgroup analysis, suggested by our patient group, will use a Bayesian ANOVA to estimate the interaction of gender and site of onset with drug.	Recruitment plan: Subjects will be recruited through a number of means: using EMR computable phenotypes to create a list of possible candidates at each site; one-on-one recruitment during individual clinic visits; using patient advocacy group (MDA, ALSA) newsletters, or clinic lists; and using the CReATE Connect ALS patient registry. The study will be listed on Clinicaltrials.gov. The 25 sites included her serve > 4,700 ALS patients.

The ALLFTD Program will enroll 500 participants from families with familial FTLD (f-FTLD) as well as 600 participants with sporadic (s-FTLD), into the in-person Longitudinal Arm of the program (totaling 1100 persons over 5 years). We will obtain up to 5 annual assessments in each subject over the 5 years of the program. Each visit will include a clinical assessment, blood collection and MRI, as well as CSF in those who are willing. Clinical data will be uploaded to a data repository (NACC), biofluid samples will be transferred to a biofluid/genetics repository (NCRAD), and imaging data will be transferred to an imaging repository (LONI). All participants will have advance directive for autopsy sought. Additionally, approx. 200 new participants will enroll each year in the Biofluid-Focused Arm with a clinical assessment and blood +/- CSF collection (totaling 1000 over 5 years), and each will be followed annually over the duration of the 5 years of the program.

The outcomes will be conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic FTLD, and from mild to moderate to severe FTLD.	1	Longitudinal-familial: We will enroll members of families with f-FTLD based on an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Most of these participants will have a previously-identified mutation in themselves or a relative. We will expand recruitment to a) other members of these families, b) to families who have a newly identified mutation in a proband in one of the 3 main genes, and c) to participants/kindreds who have no known mutation. Longitudinal-sporadic: We will enroll patients without any apparent family history who meet published diagnostic criteria for bvFTD, svPPA and nfvPPA, CBS, and PSP. All longitudinal participants: Age 18 or older (and preferably at least age 30), a reliable informant who personally speaks with or sees that subject at least weekly, subject is sufficiently fluent in English to complete all measures, willing and able to consent to the protocol with proxy assent when appropriate, and willing and able to undergo yearly evaluations, willing and able to undergo neuropsychological testing (at least at the baseline visit), and no contraindication to MRI.

Our general approach to statistical analysis will be as follows. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) models will be used to evaluate main effects of cigarette (VLNC vs conventional nicotine cigarettes) on outcomes at the end of the experimental phase. Primary outcome variables include number of cigarettes smoked per day (study only and overall), nicotine biomarkers, nicotine dependence, ADHD symptoms, neurocognitive functioning, measures of acceptability and safety, compliance, and changes in physical health and drug/alcohol/other nicotine product use. Models will be initially run without covariates, but will then be run with age, sex and socioeconomic status as covariates.	Participants will be recruited through flyers, direct mailings, television, radio, newspaper, bus, and on the internet (Craigslist advertisements, MaxPoint Ad campaigns, trianglesmokingstudies.com). Those who call into the laboratory will be read a script briefly explaining the study. After verbal informed consent is received, the participants will be asked questions over the phone to determine initial eligibility. Potential subjects can complete an on-line Qualtrics screening survey accessed from our website, after which they will be called to either be told they were not eligible or to complete a phone screen. If eligible and interested, they will be scheduled for an in-person screening interview. Potential participants will be instructed to bring a pack of their usual brand cigarettes as well as all prescription medications they are currently taking to the screening visit. \nWe will also utilize the DEDUCE system to identify eligible participants. Eligible subject's caregiver will be notified and asked to contact the potential participant to seek his or her research participation, or to seek an expression of his or her interest in learning more about the study. If he or she expresses interest a member of the study team will contact the patient and conduct a telephone screen.  \nPotential participants will also be instructed to bring a valid state issued photo ID to the screening visit. Acceptable forms of identification include a Driver's License, State Photo ID Card, Passport, or Military ID. If the potential participant does not have a valid state issued photo ID, the interviewer can provide him/her with information on obtaining one.\n\nApproximately 350 people will take part in this study at 2 different universities. At Duke, we propose to obtain consent from a total of 175 smokers with ADHD in order to have 100 participants meet all eligibility criteria.
170	2017-06-27	7	\N	\N	Clinical Trial of Automated Vestibular Rehabilitation Technique	Automated Vestibular Rehabilitation	2	Phase II clinical trial to see if an automated vestibular rehabilitation (AVR) technique is more effective than a placebo in improving dizziness symptoms in patients with unilateral vestibular dysfuncation (UVD) as measured by the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI).	We plan a prospective randomized controlled trial of the AVR device.  Patients with UVD who meet the entry criteria will be enrolled and given the AVR device in addition to instructions on standard vestibular rehabilitation exercises.  During a 1 week run-in period prior to randomization the participants will complete a static visual acuity task.  This task involves reporting the orientation of an optotype (a Landolt-C, essentially a circle with a gap in it) while both the head and optotype remain stationary.  The purpose of this run-in period is to allow people the opportunity to get used to the equipment and also determine the stability of symptoms prior to therapy(DHI will be measured at enrollment and at the end of the week, a visual analog scale will be used daily).  This period will also allow subjects to drop out prior to randomization which should improve data quality by decreasing the number of drop outs after randomization.  In the preliminary studies about half of patients who were eligible completed one or fewer sessions.\nAfter the run-in period patients will be randomized to either a placebo or the AVR task.  The placebo task involves having subjects hold their head still while reporting the orientation of a moving optotype.  This has previously been shown not to be of value.  The randomization can be performed remotely through the web-based software.  As with the run-in period the DHI will be measured weekly and daily (when the subjects login) they will complete the visual analog scale and also report whether they did the standard vestibular rehabilitation exercises that day.  The trial will persist for 4 weeks.  At the end patients who were given the placebo task will be given the opportunity to do the AVR if they wish.	The primary objective is to see if an automated vestibular rehabilitation technique is more effective than a placebo in improving dizziness symptoms in patients with unilateral vestibular dysfuncation (UVD) as measured by the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI)\n\nSecondary objectives are to measure compliance with a home based vestibular rehabilitation technique (this has not been measured before using a high quality technique).  Determine to what degree compliance is associated with outcome.  Determine if certain subgroups have a better response to therapy (e.g. underlying cause of UVD, age).  Examine time course of symptom improvement.  Also look at other outcome measures (dynamic visual acuity improvement, gain as measured with head impulse testing, a visual analog scale, SF-36, and caloric testing)	The DHI is used as the primary outcome because it is likely to be the most direct and validated measure of dizziness symptoms.   In addition to looking for a statistically significant improvement, we want to look for a clinically significant improvement.  This has previously been establishes as a 42% decrease or 22 points.	1	Inclusion criteria\n1.  Age between 18 and 79.\n2.  A significant vestibular hypofunction of at least 25% on caloric testing\n3.  A total DHI score of ≥30 with dizziness or imbalance symptoms that are likely to be caused by UVH.\n4.  Must have internet access.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1.  Diagnosis of Meniere's as defined by the criteria established by the American Academy of Otolaryngology with vertigo attacks in the past three months or have not been definitively treated with gentamicin or labyrinthectomy.\n2.  Active benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) defined as a positive Dix-Halpike test.\n3.  Symptoms exacerbated by visual motion or computer use (such symptoms are common in migraine).\n4.  A physical condition which precludes participation (e.g. blindness, poor muscle control).\n5.  Plans to complete another vestibular rehabilitation program (e.g. other than the study and the home based exercises provided)\n6.  The patient is unwilling or unable to comply with the study requirements.	The number of sites will depend on how many patients each site can provide.  Anticipate 4-5 sites, all within the United States	The technique is based around custom made universal serial bus (USB) based headsets.  Each headset contains 3 orthogonal gyros that measure head rotational velocity.  Each headset also has a unique, machine-readable serial number allowing the data to be anonymously collected.  This interfaces with custom web based software that takes the subjects through the AVR as described above.  The intervention is minimal risk.	48 months	3 months	University of Rochester holds a patent on the device being investigated	The primary statistical analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle and will include all available data from all randomized subjects, regardless of compliance with the assigned treatment.  Every effort will be made to retain subjects in this study, to promote adherence to the study protocol, and to collect all data at every visit.  If a subject cannot tolerate or refuses to continue study treatment, we will continue to follow and evaluate that subject if he/she is willing.  If a subject withdraws from the study, attempts will be made to bring the subject in for a final evaluation.  Compliance with study procedures and reasons for subject withdrawal will be tracked throughout the study.  The primary statistical analysis will involve the use of a repeated measures analysis of covariance model (i.e., the so-called "mixed model repeated measures", or MMRM, analysis strategy) There will be terms for treatment group, age, site, baseline DHI score, time (treated as a categorical variable), and interaction terms for baseline DHI score and time and for treatment group and time.  The covariance matrix for the within-subject observations will be modeled using an unstructured pattern.  Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for treatment effects (differences in adjusted group means) at each weekly assessment will be computed using this model, with the Week 4 time point being of primary interest.  A test for significance of the treatment effect at Week 4 will likewise be performed with this model using a significance level of 5% (two-tailed).\n\tAnalysis of the secondary outcomes for efficacy will involve fitting analysis of covariance models with treatment group as the factor of interest, site as a stratification factor, and age and baseline value of the outcome variable as covariates.  Another secondary outcome will be duration of the vestibular lesion and will be analyzed using analysis of covariance with treatment group as the factor of interest, site as a stratification factor, and age as a covariate.  Correlations between DVA performance and self reported measures of dizziness symptoms (at baseline, at final, and change scores) will be determined.  Compliance with therapy will be described by treatment group.  Adverse events will be tabulated by treatment group and if warranted, the treatment groups will be compared regarding the occurrence of at least one event using Fisher's exact test.  If a subject is missing a response, missing data will be imputed using a multiple imputation algorithm.  This approach is likely to be superior to other strategies such as carrying forward the last observation which can lead to unrealistic imputed values.  The use of multiple imputation avoids the issue of artificially increasing power through data imputation associated with single-imputation methods by accounting for uncertainty associated with the imputation.\n\tWe will investigate the interaction between treatment group and important baseline variables such as age, gender, and baseline DHI score by including the appropriate interaction term in the analysis of covariance model and testing for its significance.  The observation of clinically important subgroup differences in mean treatment response (e.g., men vs. women) will serve as hypothesis generation for possible future studies designed to specifically address the issue of differential therapeutic response.  (Thanks to Mike McDermott for suggesting these analysis methods).	We should like help from consulting services here.  It will likely be about 3 months to activate.  Although we have estimates on the total number of subjects needed, the number each site can provide is not clear, but I would expect a minimal of 4-5 subjects per site.

The main  value of engaging this project as a TIC is that there will be several years to assure the ideal  construction of the R01 large trial. In many ways, getting involved with funded R34 is an almost ideal scenario for us to have an impact on the ultimate larger trial. This opportunity also provides a chance to involve several TICs and the RIC in consultation as the protocol is fully  developed over a several year period. \n\n1. Get the primary institution onto SMART IRB, as well as the proposed sites for the R34 pilot.  Marginal cost = zero, because we are tasked with getting them onto SMART IRB anyway.  2. For the R34 pilot, we can act as the cIRB, we can teach the primary site how it can use  SMART IRB to be the cIRB itself, or they can go with distributed IRB for their pilot since they are  already funded. But I know that they want to use a cIRB, even though they are not required.  3. Engage the investigators with expertise from our TIC as well as the other two TICs, for purposes of study design innovation. This could include one or two face to face meetings with detailed consultation as the investigators plan the ultimate trial.  4. Engage the investigators with a consultation from the RIC, with goal of identifying CTSA affiliates with the largest number of applicable patients, with the goal of identifying the best site  investigators at the best sites so that the ultimate trial will be rapidly accrued.  5. Engage the investigators with the opportunity to bring the ultimate trial to the Trial Innovation Network as a proposal, using the intake procedures that are in place 12 to 18 months from now.  6. After identification of the clinical sites is accomplished, get those sites onto SMART IRB in anticipation of being the cIRB for the ultimate clinical trial, IF the NEC determines that this trial  should receive support and be conducted within the Trial Innovation Network.\n\nAnticipated benefits to the Network: Getting involved with funded R34 is an almost ideal scenario for us to have an impact on the ultimate larger trial.

Primary Outcome Measures\nWe have selected measures that are patient-centered and reflect the anticipated biological effects of testosterone therapy and exercise (improved muscle strength and endurance, translating into longer walking distance and mobility), or the experience and concerns of hip fracture patients.\nThe 6MWD is a standardized, validated measure of mobility, physical function, and cardiovascular fitness(82), that has been demonstrated to be safe for use in older adults(83). In the WU Hip Fracture exercise study, Binder observed improvements in 6MWD that were greater in EX than CON, with mean increases over 6 months in females of 97±87 meters vs. 66±58 meters respectively, a difference that is considered clinically meaningful for older adults(84).\n5.7 Secondary Outcome Measures\nSecondary outcome measures have been selected to provide information about 1) the mechanisms hypothesized to underlie the functional improvements that we anticipate in response to the interventions, including appendicular and total LBM using DXA, 1-RM strength for leg extension of both limbs, modified physical performance test (mPPT)(85), gait speed for 8 ft. and 50 ft. (a component of the mPPT) using switchmats with timers (Lafayette Instrument), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)(86, 87), balance (mPPT item and Berg test(88)), BMD of the non-fractured proximal femur by DXA; and 2) the impact of the interventions on daily function and quality of life (FSQ(89), OARS ADL questionnaire(90), HRQ(91), SF-36(92)). All proposed measures have been successfully implemented in WU hip fracture studies, including the 1-RM strength measure, which is feasible and safe in hip fracture patients at the baseline time point.	\N	Inclusion Criteria (Target Population)\n1.

The study has six collaborating clinical sites each with a clinical site PI and coordinator. The clinical sites are Washington University in St. Louis (WU), Baltimore-University of Maryland/Johns Hopkins (Baltimore), University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC), Hebrew SeniorLife (HSL), University of Colorado (UC), and University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB). The study does not intend to include sites outside of the United States.	Over a 6-month intervention period, participants in each of the study groups will receive treatment with either testosterone gel or placebo gel, and either a home exercise and health education, or supervised exercise that includes three months of progressive resistance training intervention. Testosterone and placebo gels will be administered in identical canisters to participants, who will be blinded to medication group assignment. All participants will be instructed in proper application of the gels by the study site coordinator/RN. Visits with exercise staff will take place at the study center. The supervised exercise training groups (EX and EX+T) will complete a supervised multimodal exercise program that includes progressive resistance training sessions and the control group (CON) will complete a home-based, low-intensity stretching program and a health promotion session. Participants in all intervention groups will receive nutritional counseling to ensure weight stability and adequate nutrient intake, as well 2000 IU vitamin D3 and 1000 mg of calcium daily for the duration of the 6-month intervention period.	\N	It will take 12 months for each participant to complete all study visits.	The research team members have no financial ties or other financial conflicts of interest related to this study.	Power computations are based on two-sided tests at the 0.05 level of significance. They focus on 6MWD, the primary outcome measure. The null hypothesis that reflects the primary goal of this study is that the change from baseline to six months in the EX group in 6MWD equals the corresponding change in the EX+T group.\nWe do not have preliminary data in females from which to directly estimate the magnitude of the projected differences from adding testosterone to the supervised exercise program. However, we do have such data from a randomized, controlled pilot study conducted at WU using the same exercise procedures involving 25 frail hypogonadal (T level <350 ng/dL) males ≥65 yrs. within 6-16 weeks of recent hip surgery. In that study, EX was associated with a 6-month increase in 6MWD of +42.7 ± 69.2 meters, as compared to +82.2 ± 92.5 meters in the EX+T group. If we assume that the benefit of adding testosterone to EX in female hip fracture patients will be of similar magnitude as the observed benefit in the male study, the sample size requirements are 68 per group for a power of 0.8, and 91 per group for a power of 0.9. After accounting for a 20% dropout rate, these sample sizes increase to 85 and 114, respectively. Our plan to randomize 100 subjects per group provides statistical power of 0.86, for an alpha level of 0.05.\nThe power computations described above are conservative for two important reasons. First, they are based on 80 subjects per group. This number reflects the assumption that no follow-up data will be available on 20% of the 100 who are randomized into each group and whom we assume will drop out before 6 months. But many of the assumed dropouts will not leave the study until after they have provided 3-month data. The availability of those additional 3-month data combined with the imputation procedures we will employ with respect to the missing 6-month data in these subjects means that power will be greater than what we have calculated when we employ our mixed model analyses using intention-to-treat. Second, all dropouts will be strongly encouraged to provide 6-month primary endpoint data. While some will be unwilling to do so, our experience has been that many will be happy to contribute in this limited way to the scientific goals of the study. This will further enhance statistical power. An added point is that we have computed power for the key comparison between EX and EX+T. However, to the extent that EX is superior to control, the power for the comparison between control and EX+T will be substantially greater than the 0.86 value calculated above.\nAlthough we believe that a sample size of 300 subjects will be sufficient for the primary analysis, we will discuss the possibility of an interim futility analysis with the Data Monitoring Safety Board (DSMB) prior to initiating the study, to guard against the possibility of wasting resources unnecessarily.\nThe analysis of data will be based on the Intention-to-Treat principle under which all patients randomized in each group will be analyzed as a part of that group regardless of subsequent events.\n\nSpecific Aim 1addresses the question of whether T therapy combined with supervised exercise (EX+T) will induce greater improvements in the 6MWD relative to the CON and EX conditions alone. The primary goal of this study are to determine if there are between-group differences in the change over time in 6MWD. Analytic strategies are based on the fact that all outcomes, including secondary outcomes, are continuous variables scheduled to be measured on at least three occasions. Initial analyses will include chi square tests and t-tests to compare baseline values of key demographic, clinical, and physiologic parameters. Because we expect the primary outcomes to be normally distributed or transformable to normality, between group comparisons of 6MWD will be performed using mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance. All mixed model analyses will be implemented using PROC MIXED in SAS and will be preceded by an evaluation of the data, intended to determine what covariance structure should be used. Since past experience suggests that correlation coefficients between time points will be greater for time points that are closer together than for time points that are further apart, we anticipate that an autoregressive or a Toeplitz covariance structure will be appropriate for these analyses. If correlation coefficients are approximately constant regardless of the time between assessment points, we expect that a compound symmetric covariance structure will fit the data best. Decisions about which covariance structure will be implemented will be made only after correlation coefficients across time have been evaluated and with appropriate considerations of the Schwarz-Bayesian criterion and Akaike's Information criterion. All other things being equal, we will give preference to correlation structures that require the estimation of the smallest number of parameters. In addition to the primary comparison of the overall model, statistical contrasts will be evaluated to determine if there are significant between-group differences in the change from baseline to 3 months and from baseline to 6 months, with the 6-month comparison being the primary study time point. Additional analyses of covariance will be performed that adjust for baseline values and covariates that differed across groups at baseline.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: The mixed model approach discussed above will be applied also to secondary endpoints. In all of the analyses we perform, we will assess the appropriateness of the selected analytic methods by determining whether required distributional assumptions are satisfied. Thus, when t-tests are performed, we will evaluate normality and equal variance assumptions before accepting the results of the test. When analyses of variance and covariance are performed, regression residuals will be evaluated to ensure that normality assumptions are satisfied. When necessary assumptions are violated, potentially useful data transformations will be considered and evaluated. In some circumstances, inappropriate distributional properties in combination with the failure to find an appropriate data transformation may lead to a decision to use non parametric rather than parametric methods of analysis. Thus, when we say above that we will perform a t-test, it is possible that the t-test will be performed on the log transformed data or that we will use Wilcoxon's test as an alternative. It is similarly possible that we will apply our mixed model analyses to transformed data or that it will be necessary to perform these analyses semi-parametrically using the ranks of the data rather than the data themselves.\n\nMissing data will be a particular concern in our mixed model analyses. To address this issue, we will collect information about reasons for the missingness to facilitate an assessment of whether missing data are ignorable. To formally determine whether data are missing completely at random, we will use a SAS macro to implement the likelihood ratio based method of Little (122). When data are missing completely at random, multiple imputation using PROC MI in SAS will be used to impute missing values and standard mixed model analyses will incorporate these imputed values. Understanding the reasons for missingness and assessments of whether variable values at baseline (when data are complete) are associated with the likelihood that they are subsequently missing will help us decide whether the data are missing at random. Unfortunately, it is not possible to test whether missing data are non-ignorably missing because the very definition of such data implies that the missing data depend on other data that are not available. If we believe that data may be non-ignorably missing, we will adopt a conservative approach to analysis and impute values that bias towards the null hypothesis. For example, if evidence suggests that subjects may have dropped out for reasons related to limited response to the interventions, we will bias towards the null by assuming that the missing data on these subjects are equal to the worst value of the outcome measure that was observed for any subject at the time points that are missing. To minimize the burden of missing data, we will encourage all subjects who withdraw from the study to undergo the final assessments that, at the very least, provide information about the primary endpoints. Our experience suggests that many subjects who choose to drop out are willing to cooperate in this way. Finally, when we suspect non-ignorable missingness, we will perform sensitivity analyses that use more than one approach to imputation in order to evaluate the robustness of our conclusions.\n\nSpecific Aim 3 addresses the question of whether the effects of the interventions persist after six months of discontinuing them. Analyses in this aim will be similar to those described for the primary specific aim in that they will employ mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance. The central differences are that analyses for this aim will include the 12 month time point and will focus on the statistical contrasts that perform between-group comparisons of changes from 6 to 12 months. In addition to p-values, we will generate confidence bounds that quantify the potential differences between the 6 to 12 month changes in different groups. We omit the details of these analyses and emphasize only that considerations related to determining covariance structures and dealing with missing data are identical to those previously discussed.	\N
146	2017-04-26	7	\N	\N	Rhythm Evaluation for AntiCoagulaTion for Atrial Fibrillation (REACT-AF)	REACT-AF Study	4	The primary aim of this proposed multicenter, prospective, nonblinded randomized controlled study is to compare rates of stroke, systemic embolization, death, and major bleeding in patients receiving chronic novel oral anticoagulation (NOAC) therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) versus those receiving time-delimited, targeted NOAC therapy guided by a continuous AF-sensing Applewatch.	Overview: Clinical Study Design                This study is a prospective multicenter unblinded 1:1 randomized trial comparing continuous NOAC versus smartwatch-guided intermittent NOAC for lower risk patients with  non-permanent AF. Physicians will prescribe marketed NOACs, which currently include Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban and Edoxaban. The REACT AF subject population will consist of AF patients considered to be at a lower baseline risk of having a stroke, but in whom anticoagulation is still indicated by current guidelines. Only patients with a CHA2DS2-VASC score of 1- 4 (baseline stroke risk of 1.3 - 4% per year) will be eligible for this trial. Subjects enrolled will be limited to those with  non-permanent AF, no prior history of stroke or TIA, no indication for a permanent pacemaker or implantable defibrillator, and currently prescribed and taking a NOAC medication.                The study is expected to be conducted in approximately 120 centers located in the United States. Roughly 6,000 subjects will be enrolled in the study to ensure 5,260 randomized subjects. To exclude patients with a high AF burden, external ECG monitors will be used in the study to screen approximately 7,800 patients prior to enrollment and randomization (1:1) , which assumes a 30% screen fail rate. Approximately 2,630 smartwatch devices will be used in the study for subjects randomized to the treatment arm. To ensure a widespread distribution of data, minimize site bias in study results, and ensure that sites will be able to adequately manage and follow subjects enrolled in the trial, the maximum number of randomized subjects allowed at a single site is 200. The enrollment period is expected to last approximately 24 months. Subjects will be followed for 30 months and then exited. Therefore, the anticipated study duration is approximately 54 months.          Outcomes Measures: Stroke (all), systemic embolization, death, and major bleeds by ISTH criteria	I.        Specific Aim 1 (Efficacy Objective)             To demonstrate that  smartwatch-guided intermittent NOAC therapy is non-inferior to continuous NOAC therapy for a composite endpoint that includes:               1.      Stroke              2.      Arterial embolism             3.      Death due to cardiovascular and unknown causes                       II.        Specific Aim 2 (Safety Objective)         To demonstrate that smartwatch-guided intermittent NOAC therapy reduces major bleeding events compared to continuous NOAC therapy.           Rationale for Primary Study Objectives     The goal of the REACT AF study is to demonstrate that smartwatch-guided, time-delimited NOAC treatment reduces the occurrence of NOAC-related major bleeding outcomes, while maintaining stroke protection and without increasing patient risk to cardiovascular events. As such, the REACT AF study has two separate objectives with two different expectations. These include: 1) an efficacy objective, aiming to demonstrate no increase in risk compared to current standard of care (continuous NOAC), and 2) a safety objective, aiming to show a reduction in major bleeding events.     To test the efficacy of smartwatch-guided time-delimited NOAC use, we will use a composite endpoint of stroke, arterial embolism, and death due to cardiovascular causes. As the standard of care, NOACs have demonstrated their ability to reduce stroke burden in AF patients by reducing cardioembolic events. Accordingly, our efficacy goal in this study is to demonstrate that the stroke risk reduction observed with NOAC use is maintained. In addition, we will include cardiovascular (CV) mortality in the efficacy endpoint to demonstrate no increase in severe cardiovascular risks. This strategy is aligned with previous IDE trials with the same objective, including the PREVAIL study that evaluated the safety of the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. Additionally, inclusion of CV mortality in our efficacy endpoint is consistent with the consensus statement on outcome parameters for trials in AF from the German Atrial Fibrillation Competence NETwork and the European Heart Rhythm Association. These groups have recommended that deaths should be included in the safety outcome for all trials in AF due to the complex consequences of this arrhythmia, and the association between AF and premature mortality.  We believe our efficacy objective can be met for two reasons: 1) patients will receive NOAC therapy when they are at risk for the types of strokes that NOACs protect against, and 2) patients may be more compliant with their NOAC regimen when only required to take NOAC as medically needed.    After demonstrating no elevated risk associated with smartwatch-guided NOAC, the second objective of this study will be to demonstrate a reduction in major bleeding risk due to the decreased time spent on NOAC. In the REACT.COM pilot study, there was a 94% reduction in the time spent on NOAC (see attachement)  providing strong evidence for the feasibility of the efficacy hypothesis in this study.	I.        Primary Objective 1 (Efficacy Objective)    To demonstrate that  ICM guided intermittent NOAC therapy is non- inferior to continuous NOAC therapy for a composite endpoint that includes:      1.

A downloaded app would allow the watch to learn a patients heart rate and heart rate variability during varying levels of activity.   If these three measures suggest the presence of atrial fibrillation for a pre-programmed duration (ie 1 hour), patients will be asked to touch the sensor on the Applewatch band that would then record a single-lead ECG which would be automatically interpreted by the Kardia software to be either normal rhythm or AF. If a threshold AF event is recorded, the patient will receive a text instructing them to restart their previously prescribed NOAC for 30 consecutive days.  Subsequent adjudication of the tracings will be performed by the treating physician during business hours.   The Kardia smartphone ECG monitor is an FDA approved medical device that is commercially available. The modified Applewatch is currently under review by the FDA and our group will be evaluating the accuracy of the AF-sensing algorithm starting May 2017 against implantable cardiac monitors.

Sample Size Determination        The sample size is determined by primary objective #2, as this objective requires the larger sample size for the two primary objectives. Details of sample size calculations are provided below for each of the study primary objectives.           Analysis Populations        The primary analysis will be conducted by intention-to-treat principles. The analysis cohort for this trial consists of all randomized subjects regardless of whether the subject received the randomly assigned treatment.           Hierarchical Testing Strategy        The conservation of type I error is desired because the study includes two primary objectives of interest. The two sets of hypotheses of interest will be tested in a hierarchical manner using a serial gatekeeping strategy.26   The hierarchy is given as follows:      1.      Primary objective #1      2.      Primary objective #2           Interim analysis        Planned interim analyses, and any unplanned interim analyses, are intended to safeguard the safety of study subjects and will be conducted under the auspices of the Data  Monitoring Committee (DMC) assigned to this study. The study will use the FDA recommended guidance entitled Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees27 to guide interim statistical analyses and DMC operations.             Sample Size Determination: Primary Objective 1 (Efficacy)    Background      The ARISTOTLE study17 was used to determine the frequency of cardiovascular death, stroke and arterial embolic events. The incidence of death, stroke, arterial embolism for those treated with apixaban was 4.49 per 100 person-years, with deaths occurring 3.52 times per 100 person-years, strokes occurring 1.19 times per 100 person-years, and arterial embolisms occurring 0.09 times per 100 person-years. Two-thirds of deaths in the study were due to cardiovascular causes.             In the ARISTOTLE study, 30% of participants had a CHADS2 score ? 3. It is estimated that approximately 15% of patients had a CHADS2 score ? 4 (corresponding to a CHA2DS2-VASc score ? 5). This estimation is based on the distribution of CHADS2 scores in Chiang C et al (2012).28 The event rates in ARISTOTLE are therefore adjusted in order to account for the lower distribution of CHA2DS2-VASc scores in REACT AF. The SPARCtool was employed to calculate the stroke risk by CHA2DS2-VASc score for patients using continuous NOAC therapy (http://www.sparctool.com/sparcnotes.htm). The overall event rate in ARISTOTLE for stroke/embolism was 1.28%. Using the SPARCtool, the average rate in the group of scores 5 or higher is 3.97%, averaged over all NOACs. Thus, the rate of stroke or arterial embolism in the range of CHA2DS2-VASc scores 4 or lower is (0.0128 - 0.0397*0.15)/0.85 = 0.00805 or            0.8% per year. Similar calculations were employed to determine the risk of stroke-related death.                 The rate of cardiovascular-related death is estimated from a subgroup analysis of the RE-LY trial.29 This subgroup analysis reported event rates for CHADS2 scores categories, choosing the categories to have an approximately equal sample size in each. The event rate is taken from the average of the 0-1 category and the 2 category. In addition, RE-LY did not report CV-related death but vascular death. Thus, this event rate is expected to be conservative. The subgroup vascular death rate is 1.55% per year in the high dose arm of the study. Using the ARISTOTLE study, 0.2% of patients with a stroke or embolism also died. Combining the ARISTOTLE and RE-LY rates together, the rate of stroke, arterial embolism, or death is 0.0155+0.008-0.002=0.0215 or 2.1% per year.                 Based on the above subset analysis from ARISTOTLE and RE-LY, we project that the primary endpoint will occur 2.1 times per 100 person years on average in randomized subjects.                 The non-inferiority margin for this objective is assumed to be an absolute risk difference of 2.5%. Previous NOAC trials, including ARISTOTLE and RE-LY, compared time to first stroke or arterial embolism using a non-inferiority margin of 1.38 and 1.46, respectively, for a hazard ratio. Here, an absolute risk difference is used to determine the non-inferiority margin for this safety endpoint rather than the hazard ratio traditionally used based on recent analysis presented in Uno H et al.  With an absolute risk difference of 2.5%, assuming that the event rate for this endpoint ranges from 2.1% to 3% per year, this margin is approximately equivalent to hazard ratios ranging from 1.35 to 1.5.  This equivalence with the hazard ratios chosen based on precedent in previous NOAC trials is the justification for the use of an absolute risk difference of 2.5%.             Sample Size Calculations        Sample size calculations were performed in PASS 2008. The allocation of study arm will be according to a 1:1 randomization schedule. A sample size is determined such that the non- inferiority of the primary objective is demonstrated and a test comparing survival curves at 30 months is used to demonstrate non-inferiority. The non-inferiority margin corresponding to an absolute risk difference of 2.5% is assumed.      The calculation further assumes a one-sided type I error rate of 0.025 and a type II error rate of 0.15 or equivalently, power of 0.85 for the final analysis. Subjects will be followed for 30 months wherever possible. The above calculation is adjusted for loss-to-follow-up, with an assumption that the loss-to-follow-up rate is 2% per year and for death due to non-cardiovascular causes, with an assumption that the non-cardiovascular death rate is 1.1% per year. The proportion of events within 30 months of follow-up for the primary endpoint is assumed, namely, 5.25% of randomized subjects. The non-inferiority margin is for this proportion is 2.5%. Thus, the non-inferiority hypothesis will require a sample size of 2940 randomized subjects. Since the superiority hypothesis described previously requires 5260 subjects, the total sample size for the study will be 5260 randomized subjects.           Analysis Methods        The primary efficacy variable will be tested with the following hypothesis:       H0:   SC(t) - ST(t) ? M for t = 30 months      HA:   SC(t) - ST(t) < M for t = 30 months        where S(t) is the survival curve for the primary endpoint at time t, and M reflects the absolute risk difference in survival curves such that M = 2.5%.               Sample Size Determination: Primary Objective 2 (safety)    Background:        The ARISTOTLE study compared apixaban to warfarin in a study of 18,201 patients with a CHADS2 score ? 1 and at least two documented episodes of AF or atrial flutter in the previous 12 months prior to enrollment.17 The incidence of major bleeding was 2.1 times per 100 person- years and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24 times per 100 person-years for those treated with apixaban.               In the ARISTOTLE study, 30% of participants had a CHADS2 score ? 3. It is estimated that approximately 15% of patients had a CHADS2 score ? 4 (corresponding to a CHA2DS2-VASc score ? 5). This estimation is based on the distribution of CHADS2 scores in Chiang C et al.28 The major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke event rates in ARISTOTLE are therefore adjusted in order to account for the lower distribution of CHA2DS2-VASc scores in REACT AF. The SPARCtool was employed to calculate the major bleeding risk by CHA2DS2-VASc score for patients using continuous NOAC therapy (http://www.sparctool.com/sparcnotes.htm). The overall event rate in ARISTOTLE for major bleeding was 2.1%. Using the SPARCtool, the average rate in the group of scores 5 or higher is 3.66%, averaged over all NOACs. Thus, the rate of major bleed in the range of 4 or lower is (0.021 - 0.0366*0.15)/0.85 = 0.0186 or 1.86% per year. The event rate for hemorrhagic stroke in ARISTOTLE is 0.24%. The hemorrhagic stroke rate is assumed to be reduced by the same proportion as the reduction in the overall stroke rate. Thus, the hemorrhagic stroke rate is 0.15% per year.               Based on the above subset analysis from ARISTOTLE, we project that the primary endpoint will occur 2.0 times per 100 person years on average in randomized subjects.           Sample Size Calculations        Sample size calculations were performed in PASS 2008. The allocation of study arm will be according to a 1:1 randomization schedule. A sample size is determined such that the superiority of the primary objective is demonstrated via a log-rank test. A reduction in major bleeding events is assumed equivalent to a hazard ratio of 0.65.      The calculation further assumes a one-sided type I error rate of 0.025 and a type II error rate of 0.15 or equivalently, power of 0.85 for the final analysis. Subjects will be followed for 30 months wherever possible. The above calculation is adjusted for loss-to-follow-up, with an assumption that the loss-to-follow-up rate is 2% per year and for death due to any cause, with an assumption that the death rate is 2.67% per year. The proportion of events within 30 months of follow-up for the primary endpoint is assumed to occur in 5% of subjects in the control arm. Thus, the superiority hypothesis will require a sample size of 5260 randomized subjects.           Analysis Methods        The primary objective will be tested with the following hypothesis:       H0:   hC(t) ? hT(t) for t ? 30 months      HA:   hC(t) > hT(t) for t ? 30 months      where h(t) is the hazard function for the primary endpoint at time t.	Patients are expected to be enrolled from cardiac electrophysiology clinics. Enrolling institutions should have an active AF program and perform AF ablations. Practices consisting of at least 2 electrophysiologists will be considered. Site initiation is expected to occur over 2 years with high-volume centers initiated first. Enrollment is expected to take place over a two year period and follow-up will range from 2-3.5 years.  Based on pilot data we expect to randomize a minimum of 2 patients per site per month.

223	2017-10-18	40	\N	\N	A randomized study of the effectiveness of an integrated tele-monitoring and patient-centric health coaching strategy (Tele-HC) in adult patients recently hospitalized with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) compared to standard care	Tele-HC	4	The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an integrated tele-monitoring and patient-centric health coaching (Tele-HC) strategy in adult patients recently hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) compared to standard care on clinical outcomes using a randomized control design. The study will evaluate clinical outcomes by looking at all-cause 60 day readmission rates for 304 patients admitted to hospital with ADHF.	General Design\nThis is a randomized controlled study evaluating consecutive adult patients hospitalized with primary or secondary diagnosis of ADHF. Patients will be randomized to receive either standard care or to the intervention group (Tele-HC model) to assess the impact of the intervention on 60 day all-cause readmission rates.\n\nRandomization\nParticipants will be allocated to their respective treatment groups through a minimalization approach that stratifies subjects based on institution, sex, and NYHA functional classification.  A second guess probability of 20% will be used to avoid deterministic assignment.\n\nStudy Procedures:\n\n1) Standard Care Arm\n\nStandard care is defined as HF care based on current ACC/AHA HF guidelines implemented and orchestrated by a cardiologist and support staff at the participating institution.  \n\n2) Intervention Arm\n\nThe Intervention arm (Tele-HC) will include standard care in addition to remote physiologic monitoring with a wearable monitor (BodyGuardian®, Preventice) coupled with tailored health coaching.  Details of the remote monitoring platform and health-coaching infrastructure are described below.\n\nECG monitoring, HR, activity, and posture will be collected via on-body sensors while BP and weight data will be collected by off-body sensors linked to BodyGuardian®.  Information will be obtained via Bluetooth enabled devices and transmitted to a cloud-based management platform that is alert and protocol driven to assist the care team in patient management.  Rhythm monitoring, classification and alerting will be the responsibility of the Mayo Clinic monitoring center in Rochester, MN.  Alerts will be communicated to the high touch care team via phone or the secure web-based portal during the hours of 7am-7pm EST, seven days a week. Outside of this time, alerts will be communicated via phone. \n\nThe remaining physiological data (HR, activity, posture, BP, and weight) will be uploaded directly to the cloud-based management platform. The cloud-based management platform patient data dashboard will identify, triage, and escalate actionable information for the study team to review via a secure web portal.  Patient-generated biometric data will be continuously analyzed and displayed on an hourly basis.  Patient-reported symptom information will also be captured.  The dashboard uses color-coded (red, yellow, green) to quickly communicate exception data.  Live data will be evaluated by the care team 7 days per week from 7am - 7 pm EST with additional monitoring and evaluation of the transmitted data on an as needed basis for calls generated outside of the 12-hour monitoring window.  \n\nAn RN will be designated as the primary coach on the high touch study team focused on disease management including symptom recognition, adherence to treatment strategies, care coordination, medication matters, and problem solving.  Medication matters include initial medication reconciliation and the organization of resources to obtain medications for patients who have socioeconomic challenges.  A RN will also be responsible for onboarding subjects, managing socio-economic challenges, and providing a nutrition and wellness assessment and goal setting.  The high touch study team establishes a patient-centric relationship using techniques of motivational interviewing coupled with a transactional model of communication.24, 25 Health literacy will be assessed using a validated tool to help personalize coaching interactions.  Coaching topics will include the patient's understanding of their disease, establishing goals of health, treatment strategies, medication adherence, and therapy expectations.  As the high touch study team identifies knowledge deficits, they customize the education and employ the teach-back methodology to address the gaps.  The high touch study team will engage the patient in collaborative care planning and goal setting to ensure interventions are congruent with the patient's readiness for change, needs, values, culture, desires, and health goals.  Patient engagement and self-care management will be measured with the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index in a pre-test/post-test fashion at the time of enrollment and at 60 days post-enrollment.\n\nThe research coordinator will screen patients hospitalized with ADHF.  Those who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to standard care or the Tele-HC intervention and enrolled in the study.  Demographic and clinical data will be collected. \n\nAll patients will be assessed at 30 days and 60 days for the occurrence of re-hospitalization and all-cause mortality. De-identified hospital records will be collected so that the study monitor can review to verify cause of re-hospitalization	Primary Objective\nTo demonstrate that Tele-HC in adult patients recently hospitalized with ADHF compared to standard care reduces all cause readmissions rates at 60 days.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n1) Quantify the time to the first readmission or death\n2) Quantify the number of hospital readmissions or ER visits \n3) Quantify all-cause mortality	Primary Study Endpoint\nOccurrence of all-cause hospital readmissions or death within 60 days of randomization\n\nSecondary Study Endpoints (timeframe 60 days)\n•\tTime to readmission or death\n•\tNumber of hospital readmissions or ER visits (visits without admissions)\n•\tAll-cause mortality	1	Inclusion Criteria\n•\tHospitalized with primary or secondary diagnosis of ADHF (one or more of these symptoms:  shortness of breath, orthopnea or edema AND may have one or more of these signs:  rales, peripheral edema, ascites, or pulmonary vascular congestion on chest radiography)\n•\tAdult patients >18 years old\n\nExclusion Criteria\n•\tOverall life expectancy < 1 year\n•\tKnown skin allergy to adhesives (hydrocolloid, silicone, acrylic)\n•\tActive systemic infection\n•\tEnd stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis  \n•\tSubject or caregiver is not visually and tactile capable of smartphone and home device usage\n•\tInadequate cell phone coverage (including international patients or international travel during study period)\n•\tSubject or legal guardian is not willing and able to provide appropriate informed consent	No specific number of sites.  Sites will include any hospitals within the USA which have the infrastructure capable of supporting a clinical trial	BodyGuardian®\nThe end-to-end remote monitoring system is a mobile, multi-tiered healthcare platform which links personal health sensors (front-end) to secure mobile communication devices to enable transmission of discrete and summarized physiologic and symptom information to providers (back-end).  The front-end includes an adhesive body sensor (BodyGuardian®) which acquires/quantifies HR, ECG, RR, and activity and has been FDA-cleared (510k) and CE Marked for detection of non-lethal cardiac arrhythmias.  The BodyGuardian® control unit (including sensor) is a patch-style device which can be worn either horizontally or vertically on the chest and is comprised of the rechargeable control unit and a disposable adhesive strip (SnapStrip™).  The SnapStrip™ has four conductive pads covered by pre-applied hydroelectric gel which can be worn while showering.  The system is able to wirelessly communicate with a commercially available BP monitor and cuff and scale.\n\nThe BodyGuardian® control unit has a 32-bit ARM processor with 1 Gigabit of on-board memory.  The device uses a Lithium-ION rechargeable battery.  The BodyGuardian® control unit runs approximately 24 hours between recharges.  The sensors collect and correlate three areas of on-body physiologic measures: 1) ECG, HR, RR variability, and HR reliability that can be used to assess skin contact quality of the electrodes; 2) respiration derived from bio-impedance measurements; and 3) body-position along with a summarized measure of activity derived from a 3-axis accelerometer.  The system also acquires off-body measures via Bluetooth connectivity including weight and BP.\n\nPhysiologic information is securely transmitted to a remote data storage center (the Cloud) using mobile phone technology as the communication hub.  The system can also function as an event recorder where the mobile phone automatically solicits symptoms (if directed by the physician) from the user-triggered events and by programs which analyze the acquired physiologic data. The secure central data center (the Cloud) stores information and a proprietary mid-tier logic layer supports development of automated alerts, messages, and other personalized health applications.  \n\nThe Preventice Care Platform is the proprietary web and mobile software which enables the BodyGuardian® system access to data stored in the Cloud and includes server support, web-based user-interfaces (UIs), and access for mobile applications for clinicians.  Server hardware physically resides in a secure SSAE-16 compliant data center.  The server is built upon grid technologies that allow a dynamic increase or decrease in processing, storage, and network capacity based on workload.  Personal health information and clinical measurements are stored separately.  \n\nThe BodyGuardian® Connect mobile application runs on an Android smartphone which provides data transmission as well as user interfaces (UIs) for control and monitoring.  Data are immediately sent to the Preventice Care Platform if network connectivity is available; otherwise data are stored on the handset until the network is available.  The handset has the capacity to store several gigabytes of data locally when network connectivity is not available.  Data are automatically forwarded to the Cloud where clinicians can review the information.  \n\nRemotely acquired data will be transmitted to the Mayo Heart Rhythm and Physiologic Monitoring Laboratory.  This is a clinical area staffed 24/7 by Mayo Clinic monitoring technicians at 4 Domitilla (St. Mary's Hospital) who have been fully trained to use the BodyGuardian® system and are currently using this system clinically for remote monitoring of patients for non-lethal cardiac arrhythmia.  Data will also be transmitted to a cloud-based management platform that is alert and protocol driven to assist the care team in patient management (see section below).  Rhythm monitoring, classification and alerting will be the responsibility of the Mayo Clinic Remote Monitoring Center in Rochester, MN.  Alerts will be communicated via phone or the secure web-based portal during the hours of 7am-7pm EST, seven days a week; outside this time range alerts will be communicated via phone. \n\nHigh Touch Service\nThe high touch service includes utilization of a cloud-based management platform built on an open source EMR architecture. Physiological data (ECG, HR, activity, respiration, posture, BP, and weight) will be uploaded directly to a cloud-based management platform.  The cloud-based management platform patient data dashboard will identify, triage, and escalate actionable information for the study team to review via a secure web portal.  Patient-generated biometric data will be continuously analyzed and displayed on an hourly basis.  Patient-reported symptom information will also be captured.

490	2019-04-03	20	\N	t	Brain Dopaminergic Signaling in Opioid Use Disorders	Dopamine and Opioid Use	6	The chemical messenger dopamine carries signals between brain cells. It may affect addiction. Heavy use of pain medicines called opioids may decrease the amount of dopamine available to the brain. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with positive outcomes including decreased illicit drug use. But these medications remain underutilized, in part because of stigma and because little is known about how these medications affect brain function. We hypothesize that patients actively using illicit opioids will have abnormal markers of brain dopamine function, but that individuals on MAT will have markers of dopamine function that more closely resemble that of healthy adults.	Single-blind. Participants will undergo three scans with positron emission tomography (PET): one with [11C]NNC-112 to assess baseline D1R, another with [11C]raclopride after placebo to assess baseline D2R and a third one with [11C]raclopride after MP administration (60mg oral) to assess striatal DA release (assessed as the difference in specific binding of [11C]raclopride between baseline and MP). In addition, participants will undergo two imaging sessions with MRI to assess functional reactivity to drug-cues and to a measure of self-control (delayed discounting task), to assess RFC and to obtain structural brain measures (including diffusion tensor imaging, DTI). One of the sessions will be done under baseline conditions (no drug administered) and the other after MP (about one hour after the [11C]raclopride MP scan is completed). Neuropsychological tests (NP) and accelerometers will be used to assess cognitive performance and locomotor activity respectively	The primary objective is to assess whether the balance between dopamine D1 (D1R) and D2 receptors (D2R) signaling in striatum is disrupted in participants with an opioid use disorder (OUD) who are on opioid agonist medication (MAT+: methadone or buprenorphine) relative to OUD participants treated with the opioid antagonist medication (naltrexone) and OUD participants not being treated with medications (MAT). Secondary objectives are to assess how striatal D1R to D2R availability (assessed with PET) influences: (1) striatal dopamine (DA) release; (2) the function of brain reward and self-control networks (assessed with task fMRI activation and with resting functional connectivity, RFC) and (3) behavior (locomotor activity and neuropsychological tests) and (4) to assess if DA increases, as induced by oral methylphenidate (MP), improve the function of brain reward and control networks in OUD; and (5) to assess if there is recovery after protracted treatment (comparing treated and non-treated) by repeating fMRI at 6 month follow-up.	Main outcome: (1) Differences in D1R to D2R striatal ratio between participants with an OUD and controls and between MAT+, natrexone, and MAT- groups. Secondary outcomes: Correlations between striatal D1R to D2R and (1) striatal DA release; (2) fMRI activation in reward and controls networks (assessed with cuereactivity and delay discounting tasks, and with RFC) and (3) NP performance and locomotor activity. (4) Differences in fMRI activation and RFC after MP when compared with baseline measures.	1	INCLUSION CRITERIA:\nHealthy Volunteer Participants\n\nMales or females between 18 and 65 years of age.\nAbility to provide written informed consent.\nMAT- Opiate Use Disorder (OUD) Participants\n\nMales or females between 18 and 65 years of age.\nAbility to provide written informed consent.\nDSM-5 diagnosis of a moderate or severe OUD (established through history and clinical exam).\nActive abuse of opiates (last use within one week of study as assessed by self-reports).\nMinimum 5 year history of opiate abuse - self-report.\nMust consume opiates at least 5 days per week as per self-report.\nCurrently not receiving medications for OUD (methadone, buprenorphine or naltrexone).\nMAT+ OUD Participants\n\nMales or females between 18 and 65 years of age.\nAbility to provide written informed consent.\nDSM-5 diagnosis of a moderate or severe OUD (established through history and clinical exam).\nActive or non-active abuse of opiates.\nMinimum 5 year history of opiate abuse as per self-report.\nMust have consumed at least 5 days per week (prior opiate use) as per self-report.\nReceiving opioid agonist therapy for OUD (e.g., methadone or buprenorphine) and must have taken for at least week before imaging study.\nNaltrexone OUD Participants\n\nMales or females between 18 and 65 years of age.\nAbility to provide written informed consent.\nDSM-5 diagnosis of a moderate or severe OUD (established through history and clinical exam).\nActive or non-active abuse of opiates.\nMinimum 5 year history of opiate abuse as per self-report.\nMust have consumed at least 5 days per week (prior opiate use) as per self-report.\nReceiving naltrexone treatment for their OUD and must have taken at least one week before imaging study.\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nAll Subjects\n\n-Unwilling or unable to refrain from use within 24 hours of scheduled study procedures: psychoactive medications or medication that may affect study results (e.g., antibiotics (must finish course at least 24 hours prior to a scheduled procedure), analgesics (non-narcotic and narcotic for healthy volunteers only); antidiarrheal preparations, anti-inflammatory drugs [systemic corticosteroids are exclusionary], anti-nausea, cough/cold preparations) (self-report, medical history).

478	2019-03-18	20	\N	t	A Pilot Study Examining Conscious Awareness and Cognitive Experiences During Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest	DHCA Study	6	The purpose of this proposal is to determine the feasibility of using study methods originally developed\nfor use during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, to measure cerebral oxygenation and cortical function as well as tests\nof cognitive processing. Specifically, we aim to assess the feasibility of using a portable tablet computer loaded with\na random image generator and auditory device and timer during DHCA and non-DHCA surgeries, in order to\nobjectively test and time the claims of visual and auditory perceptions and awareness as well as their relationship\nbetween markers of brain activity including electroencephalography (EEG).The current project will test the hypothesis that\nmental and cognitive activity as well as conscious awareness may occur during cardiac standstill states, including\nDHCA, and that this may be related to underlying cortical activity	This is an observational prospective pilot study of up to 50 DHCA patients and 10 control patients, designed to\ndevelop and optimize study methods for a larger future study. Due to the rarity of reports of awareness in patients\nwho undergo DHCA, we will include 60 total patients for efficacy and reliability of data. The study will be divided into\ntwo phases. The first phase will assess the feasibility of employing the study measures to assess claims of awareness\nduring DHCA in 15 DHCA patients. After preliminary review of the study procedures, Dr. Parnia will decide whether\nor not to move onto the next phase. The second phase will be the pilot phase of the study, aimed at expanding the\nstudy population and refining study methods. This phase will include 35 DHCA subjects and 10 control subjects.\nThe study will maintain a data coordinating center located at New York University Langone Health (NYULH) under\nthe direction of the study Principal /Chief Investigator (Dr. Sam Parnia). \n\nMethods: Specially designed visual and auditory stimuli will be administered at the time of surgery using a tablet\ncomputer and headphones. Subjects will have monitoring of cerebral oxygenation using cerebral oximetry and\ncortical activity using electroencephalography (EEG). After surgical recovery, subjects will be administered an\napproximately 45 minute interview to examine for the presence of explicit and implicit memories of DHCA. As part\nof the interview, they will be asked whether they had previously been exposed to specific visual and auditory stimuli,\nand they will be asked to designate a preferred item within pairs of visual and auditory stimuli. A control group of\nnon-DHCA surgical patients will also be interviewed in order to assess baseline measures of memory and awareness\nduring surgery	Aims and Objectives\nThe over-arching aim of this pilot study is to assess the relationship between claims of visual and auditory\nperceptions and awareness among DHCA patients and markers of brain activity including electroencephalography\n(EEG).\nStudy objectives:\n1. Assess the feasibility of using a portable tablet computer loaded with a random image generator and\nauditory device and timer during DHCA, in order to objectively test and time the claims of visual and\nauditory perceptions and awareness among DHCA patients, with patients who did not undergo DHCA\nprocedures as a control for comparison.\n2. Determine the spectrum of visual and auditory processing, whether implicit or explicit, during DHCA.\n3. Assess the presence of an associated between consciousness and awareness and brain stem and/or cortical\nactivity measure by EEG as well as specific cerebral oxygenation thresholds.\n4. Evaluate the qualitative nature of patients' experiences and cognitive activity during DHCA\n5. Evaluate the role of suggestibility in patient recollections after DHCA	Primary Outcome Measure:\n1.

Center and\nvariability of continuous variables will be presented as means ± standard deviations (SDs) when they follow a normal\ndistribution and as medians and interquartile range otherwise. The EEG data and cerebral brain oximetry data will be\ncompared between subjects who report some memory fragments during DHCA and subjects who don't have such\nreport by using Wilcoxon's rank sum test. We hypothesize that those who report some memory fragments during\nDHCA have measurable brain activity through EEG and higher cerebral oxygen levels. The correlation between brain\nactivity and oxygen levels during DHCA will be explored through Spearman's rho in subjects who may report some\nmemory fragments during resuscitation, respectively. In terms of managing any missing data that may arise, we will\nperform a sensitivity analysis. Initially, we will analyze the complete data wherever this has been completed and\nwithout the need for imputation. We will then use an imputation method for the purpose of managing data that is\nmissing at random. As regards managing data that is not missing at random methods such as pattern mixture model\nwill be utilized.\nData from control subjects will be used to compare the frequency of reported memories in subjects undergoing\nDHCA. All subjects in this study will undergo the same qualitative tests to see if there is a difference in scoring\nbetween the two groups. We will evaluate for the change in frequency of reports of conscious awareness between\nthe two groups, as well as other measures, to identify differences between the DHCA and control groups. As this is a\npilot study, we are assessing the feasibility of conducting these study measures in control subjects.	In order to identify patients for the DHCA cohort, the study team will develop a workflow with cardiothoracic\nsurgeons to be notified of all upcoming DHCA procedures. Once a potential subject is identified, research personnel\nwill approach them for consent at a convenient time before their procedure. Contact will be made either by phone\nor in-person before the procedure. Contact will be made only after the treating physician has notified the patient\nthat they will be having the DHCA surgery. The study team member responsible for contacting the patient will speak\nwith the patient's care team to confirm that the patient has been notified prior to making contact. The study team\nmember will explain the study in detail, answer any questions the patient has, confirm that the patient understands\nwhat is being asked of them, and ask that they sign the consent form. For patients who are contacted by phone, the\nstudy team will utilize a telephone script to summarize the study. At the end of the conversation, the patient will be\nasked if they are interested in participating in the study. If the patient is interested in participating, the study team\nwill arrange to have the patient sign consent prior to their DHCA procedure, either in a pre-operation clinic visit or\nwhen the patient is admitted to the hospital for their procedure. Once the consent form is signed, the study team\nmember will conduct the AMTS to serve as the baseline for their mental status before the procedure. If the patient's\nAMTS value indicates a possible neurocognitive deficit, that patient will be considered a screen failure and will not\nbe included in the study.\nIn order to identify patients for the Control cohort, the study team will gain access to the Operating Room schedule\nthat is available in EPIC. The study team will check the reports daily to identify patients who may satisfy the inclusion\nand exclusion criteria who have upcoming, non-DHCA surgeries that will require anesthesia. Once a patient is\nidentified, a study team member will contact the care team to notify them of the intention to approach the patient.\nThe designated research personnel will approach the patient in the hospital prior to their surgery to begin the\nconsent process. The study team member will explain the study in detail, answer any questions the patient has,\nconfirm that the patient understands what is being asked of them, and ask that they sign the consent form. Once the\nconsent form is signed, the study team member will conduct the AMTS to confirm mental status for baseline. If the\npatient's AMTS value indicates a possible neurocognitive deficit, that patient will be considered a screen failure and\nwill not be included in the study.\nStudy #: S18-01184 Page 6 of 24\nVersion Date: November 13, 2018, V1\nIn both cohorts, the patients will be given ample time to consider their involvement in the study and the study team\nwill be available to answer any questions that the patients may have about the study. Once the patients sign consent\nevery effort will be made to ensure patient privacy and confidentiality. Subjects will be assigned a unique patient\nidentifier, the key to which will be maintained in a password-protected file maintained by the study team. All\npertinent patient data that is collected during study procedures will be compiled into Case Report Forms (CRF's) that\nare labelled with the subject's unique identifier. The data will then be securely stored using REDCap software.

BE progresses via  the development of histological dysplasia to adenocarcinoma. Sedated endoscopy is currently used to screen for BE.  This approach is invasive and expensive and not suitable for widespread application.  Endoscopic surveillance is  currently recommended for the detection of dysplasia but is limited by poor compliance and sampling error. We have developed and validated a minimally invasive tool ( a capsule sponge, which consists of a polyurethane foam sponge enclosed in a gelatin shell, attached to a string, [sponge on string : SOS] which is swallowed by the patient, followed by dissolution of the gelatin shell releasing a 25 mm compressible sponge.  The sponge is then pulled out with the attached string, providing esophageal cytology samples ) and novel molecular markers (methylated DNA markers [MDMs]) for the non-endoscopic detection of Barrett's esophagus and related dysplasia. Hence our central hypothesis is that novel discriminant MDMs assayed on esophageal cytology specimens obtained via the SOS device will enable accurate BE and prevalent dysplasia/EAC detection, in patients with and without chronic GERD.	SA 1: To assess the positive and negative predictive value of a SOS test in a community cohort. Individuals living in a nine county area around Rochester, Minnesota, who do not have a prior history of BE will be invited to undergo the SOS test. SA1a. Participants with a positive SOS test will be offered endoscopy to assess the PPV of a positive test. Predictors of a positive SOS test will be assessed. SA1b. A matched sample of participants with a negative SOS test will also be offered endoscopy to assess the NPV of a negative SOS test in a community population. \n\nSA 2: To assess factors influencing specificity of a BE diagnosis made using MDMs assayed on esophageal cytology SOS specimens.  Patients undergoing clinically indicated endoscopy at three medical centers (meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria), will be offered the SOS test before endoscopy. Endoscopic assessment will be the gold standard for a BE diagnosis. SA2a. Assess covariates (age, gender, smoking history, ethnicity and BMI) influencing MDM levels in cases and controls and validate specificity cut offs of selected marker combinations in a low prevalence population. SA 2b Compare prevalence of BE in participants with and without chronic GERD (assessed by a validated questionnaire).\n\nSA 3: To assess the detection accuracy for prevalent dysplasia/EAC in BE cases with the application of novel neoplasia-associated MDMs. SA3a. The sensitivity and specificity of a three MDM panel for the detection of dysplasia/EAC will be assessed in BE patients, using surveillance histopathology as the gold standard. SA3b.Assess the rate of missed dysplasia during surveillance endoscopy. Patients with a positive MDM panel but negative surveillance histology will be assessed with subsequent intensive endoscopic evaluation using advanced imaging techniques (Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy) to detect missed dysplasia. Additional endoscopic revaluation will be conducted at twelve months to detect incident dysplasia.

Participants will swallow the capsule sponge ((EsophaCap, Capnostics, Doylestown PA) with a few sips of water and will be given the option of pharyngeal anesthesia with lidocaine spray before or after swallowing the capsule. The sponge will then be pulled with the attached cord 8 minutes after swallowing the capsule (to allow sufficient time for the shell to dissolve completely and release the 25 mm compressible sponge).

242	\N	99	\N	\N	Development of a Multi-center Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment Registry and Research Consortium	HBO Registry	6	Hyperbaric oxygen is used as a treatment for late radiation damage after radiation therapy for cancer (e.g. osteoradionecrosis, radiation proctitis, radiation cystitis), and for other indications (e.g. diabetic foot ulcers, refractory osteomyelitis). Basic science data and clinical case series suggest that hyperbaric oxygen should be translated into use in several other areas where new treatment modalities are needed (inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, preconditioning prior to certain interventions). But, the research infrastructure to allow this to happen does not exist. We propose to bring together 3 academically-focused hyperbaric programs, establish an outcomes-focused hyperbaric registry, and initiate a clinical trials network that could translate new observations in hyperbaric oxygen into definitive trials.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

205	2017-09-07	40	\N	\N	Lipoic acid for the treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis	LA in PMS	2	Purpose of this multi-site randomized, placebo-controlled trial is to determine if the supplement, lipoic acid (LA), can slow disability progression, reduce brain atrophy, and is safe and tolerated in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (PMS). The 118 participants will be enrolled over an 18 month period at 7 study sites. There are 7 study visits over the course of the 2 year trial. Study sites include Veterans administration sites (3) and non-VA sites (4).	This is a phase 2, double-blind, multi-center randomized controlled trial to compare the daily administration of 1200 mg oral LA to a placebo, as a disease-modifying treatment in PMS. A total of 118 subjects with PMS will be randomized 1:1 to LA or placebo. None of the study procedures involve usual care.	The primary objective is to determine if LA is superior to placebo in reducing the clinical decline (progression) in people with PMS. This will be measured as the ability of LA over placebo in maintaining mobility as measured by the primary outcome of change in completion time of the Timed 25 Foot Walk. Secondary mobility outcomes are changes in the 2 Minute Timed Walk and fall counts for consistency of the effects of LA on mobility. Additional clinical secondary outcome measures are changes in neurological disability, cognition, mood, and quality of life.\n\nThe secondary objective is to determine if LA is superior to placebo in slowing whole brain atrophy, the gold-standard MRI surrogate outcome measure in PMS trials, with an estimated 40-50%% effect size. Additional MRI secondary outcome measures are white and grey matter atrophy, T2 lesion volume, and brain segmentation volumes.\n\nThe third objective is to monitor the safety and tolerability of LA via laboratory testing and adverse event reporting.	The primary outcome measure is change in completion time of the Timed 25 Foot Walk.\n\nSecondary mobility outcomes are changes in the 2 Minute Timed Walk and fall counts for consistency of the effects of LA on mobility. Additional clinical secondary outcome measures are changes in neurological disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS), tests of manual dexterity (9 Hole Peg Test) and cognition (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, California Verbal Learning Test- Second Edition, and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test- Revised). Questionnaires using the Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information Systems (PROMIS) will be used to assess pain intensity, pain interference, and ability to participate in social roles. Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), sleep (Last Night Sleep Quality and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Assessment), and fatigue (Modified Fatigue impact Scale) will also be captured. \n\nTertiary outcomes of safety and tolerability will utilize safety laboratory tests at 6 of the 7 visits, adverse event reporting, and development of suicidality (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale).	1	Inclusion criteria:\ni.\tAge > 18 years.\nii.\tPrevious diagnosis of Relapsing remitting MS or Primary Progressive MS by 2010 revised McDonald criteria. \niii.\tCurrent Secondary Progressive MS or Primary Progressive MS.\niv.\tProgression of MS in the previous 2 years defined by medical record or reliable historical interview as:\na.\tNon relapse-related MS decline resulting in a 0.5 step change in EDSS, decline in T25FW, or other clinically documented decline (can be assigned retrospectively) if not on a disease-modifying therapy, OR\nb.\tIf currently on a DMT, non relapse-related MS decline resulting in a 0.5 step change in EDSS, decline in T25FW, or other clinically documented decline (can be assigned retrospectively) while on the current disease-modifying therapy taken continuously for at least 1 year prior to enrolment.\nv.\tAble to give informed consent and to adhere to study procedures.\nvi.\tEDSS 3.0 to 6.5.\nExclusion criteria: \ni.\tA self-reported medical or neurological problem other than MS that is a cause of progressive or fluctuating gait dysfunction (e.g. worsening neuropathy, uncontrolled lower extremity arthritis, uncontrolled cardiopulmonary disease).

This study plans on including 3 VA sites (Portland Oregon, Puget Sound Health Care System, District of Columbia) and 4 Non-VA sites (University of Vermont; Swedish MS Center; University of Utah; University of Alabama; Oregon Health and Science University). Note that the PI (Dr. Spain) has a joint appointment at the Portland VA and the Oregon Health and Science University and that site will include both the Portland VA as well as the Oregon Health and Science University. \n\nAdditional sites may be considered if recruitment is slow. A site in Canada is being considered but is not officially a part of this protocol at this point.	The intervention is the daily administration of 1200 mg oral LA or a placebo. Source of investigational drug. Source of investigational drug: Pure Encapsulations®, which follows Good Manufacturing Procedures in their production of LA, will provide gelatin capsules containing 600 mg of LA and the encapsulated placebo rendered to appear similar to LA. \nInvestigational New Drug (IND).

Study timeline and visit scheduling. The anticipated study recruitment period is for the first 18 months once the study is approved at the first study site or until enrolment is completed, whichever occurs first. The study will end when the last participant exits the study. There will be no more than 60 days inclusive between the screen and baseline visits. Thereafter study visits will occur +/- 2 weeks from the ideal visit based on the month (M) zero visit. Participants remain in the study for 2 years, and data analysis is planned for 6 months after the final subject exits for a total of 48 months once enrolment begins.	Participants remain in the study for 2 years. Adverse events or other reasons may require an unscheduled visit 3 months after the final study visit.	There are no financial ties or other conflicts of interest by any study team member or study team organizations related to this study.	We will use the mixed model approach to compare, between the treatment groups, mean rates of change from baseline in the times to complete the T25FW. We will use the transformation 25/T25FW, which is the walking speed in feet per second. In constructing these models for the T25FW walking speed outcome, we will incorporate as a predictor the factor used for randomization, baseline disability. We are primarily interested in whether there is a difference between the treatment groups in the T25FW rate changes. Given evidence of interaction, comparisons of both 12 and 24 month change between the treatment groups will be made, using a Bonferroni multiple comparison adjustment for two time points of interest. Additional models will include as covariates, baseline measures of disease duration and use of MS medications if significantly related to the response when added to the original model or result in a 10% change or greater in the estimated overall treatment effect. Secondarily, we will compare with a t-test or nonparametric tests the proportion of participants who demonstrate clinically significant worsening in gait defined by a 20% improvement in the T25FW and/or 2MTW and/or requires greater assistance to walk (e.g. newly require a cane, transition from cane to walker, etc.). We will do sensitivity analyses using an intention to treat analysis with the cross-over with and without participants who have a change in their disease-modifying therapy during the course of the study. We will add compliance information as determined by pill-counts to the mixed model. \nThe impact of LA on falls frequency will be assessed by comparing changes in fall frequency from the first to the last 3 months. A principal intention-to-treat analysis using linear Poisson mixed models to evaluate the association between time period, fall frequency, and group allocation will test the hypothesis that fall frequency is reduced more by LA than placebo. Mixed models will be used to correct for autocorrelation of within-subject repeated measures and allow for missing data, and include covariates associated with falling such as age, level of disability, and use of a walking aid. As exploratory secondary outcome measure, we will investigate the disconjugate composite endpoint based on sustained change in EDSS, clinically significant worsening in gait as defined above, or 20% increase in 9HPT.\nThe mixed model approach will compare the mean rates of change from baseline in brain as measured by SIENA. Age, sex, and disease duration will be used as covariates along with disability as determined by the randomization method.  \nWe will tabulate all adverse and serious adverse events and compare the differences in the occurrence and the frequencies between the two groups. The frequency of side effects will be compared using χ2 tests or Fisher's exact test as appropriate depending on the number of adverse events seen.\nFor evaluation of patient safety, laboratory test results at baseline and changes from baseline will be summarized and compared using t-tests for continuous measures and Fisher's exact test for proportions	The anticipated study recruitment period is for the first 18 months once the study is approved at the first study site or until enrolment is completed, whichever occurs first. The study will end when the last participant exits the study. There will be no more than 60 days inclusive between the screen and baseline visits. Thereafter study visits will occur +/- 2 weeks from the ideal visit based on the month (M) zero visit. \n\nEstimation is that it will take 6 months for all the sites to have gained IRB approval and start recruiting. Recruitment is likely to be equal between sites (approximately 10-15 per site) with the exception of the principal site, the VA Portland Health Care System, which is the site of the PI and is likely to recruit 15-25 due to local enthusiasm for the study.\nThe enrolment period of 18 months means that sites will need to recruit less than subject per month or less. This is in line with the recruitment rate of a pilot study of LA in a progressive population at the Portland site.

This will be accomplished through a consortium between the four Massachusetts CTSA hubs (Boston University, Harvard University, Tufts University and University of Massachusetts) and the Boston Breast Cancer Equity Coalition. First, we will deploy regional CTSA expertise to support the local healthcare community to overcome barriers to integrating evidence-based practices into every day care through the development of three generalizable tools: 1. a real-time shared patient registry that monitors cancer treatment utilization, 2. a platform to systematically screen for social contextual barriers to care and then identify local resources to address them, and 3. a patient navigation network that collaborates across health systems. Then, we will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study among 800 vulnerable breast cancer patients seeking care across six health systems in Boston. We will evaluate the health care system's ability to implement these three generalizable tools (acceptability/appropriateness, fidelity to intervention protocol, costs, local adoption/sustainability) into an integrated intervention and the impact on clinical outcomes (time to first treatment and receipt of guideline concordant cancer care). Finally, we will promote widespread translation/dissemination to other CTSA hubs, health systems and community-academic partnerships. Our main hypothesis is that widespread implementation of these tools will eliminate care delivery disparities, and CTSA hubs have the translational expertise to overcome barriers to such implementation.	Aim 1) Conduct a mixed-methods needs assessment to characterize existing barriers to and  inconsistencies in the implementation of: patient navigation, patient registries and screening for social  determinants of health.  Approach: We will design and conduct a mixed-methods, multi-level assessment of existing evidence-based  processes across the city of Boston to establish a baseline status of these three intervention strategies: patient  navigation, patient registries/tracking systems, and screening/referral for social determinants of health. Mixed methods  include quantitative surveys and qualitative key informant interviews and observations to ensure a  comprehensive assessment of known and unanticipated roadblocks to evidence-based implementation. Multilevels  relate to the multiple layers of the health system: patient, providers, health system administrators and  community-based programs.     Aim 2) Develop a generalizable regional registry to monitor breast cancer treatment utilization and  outcomes across Boston.  The approach to this challenge will be as follows:  1. A joint collaboration of the informatics service at each of the healthcare systems, along with community  engagement with breast cancer clinicians, and state and city public health officials,  a. This collaboration will outline the data elements for inclusion in the data dashboard, and sources of the  data for each element, and the timeframe to electronic capture of each element relative to the patient's care.  We will utilize and extend existing metrics for initiation and completion of care.  2. We will establish a repository of fully identified administrative and clinical data from multiple clinical  sites across Boston for all newly diagnosed breast cancers. Using a Master Patient Index (MPI), information on  the same patient who appears in multiple systems will be assigned to a single (encoded) identity.    Aim 3) Create a platform to conduct systematic screening for social determinants of health and provide  systematic referral tools to address these barriers to care.  Approach:  Building on existing expertise and tools developed for the City of  Boston, we will develop a systematic process that will identify these patient barriers and assist their care  providers in accessing community resources to address them.     Aim 4) Conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to monitor for reduction in delays in  cancer care among Black, non-Hispanic women in Boston.  Approach: Using Aim 1 data on existing barriers and facilitators to implementation of the three tools, the  community Coalition will lead implementation of the identified best practices for the three tools across the  Boston health systems, including relevant community programs. We will use an effectiveness-implementation  hybrid type 2 study design which combines elements of clinical effectiveness and implementation research to  enhance public health impact of study findings.  We will work with the stakeholders to design an intervention 'Toolkit' targeted at barriers,  standardizations, independent checks, reminders and learning from mistakes. We will execute the Toolkit  across the health systems in Boston using and Observational Stepped Wedge Design, where the intervention  is rolled out in a staggered manner over time, in groups of experimental units, so that as time goes on, more  and more units experience the intervention. By the end, all units experience the intervention.	1) Conduct a mixed-methods needs assessment to characterize existing barriers to and inconsistencies in the implementation of: patient navigation, patient registries and screening for social determinants of health. Using CTSA hub community engagement expertise, we will design and conduct a multi-level assessment of existing evidence-based processes across the city of Boston.   2) Develop a generalizable regional registry to monitor breast cancer treatment utilization and outcomes across Boston. Using CTSA hub bioinformatics and regulatory expertise, we will create a real time, longitudinal patient care registry to support patient navigation within and across Boston care facilities.   3) Create a platform to conduct systematic screening for social determinants of health and provide systematic referral tools to address these barriers to care. Building on existing expertise and tools developed for the City of Boston, we will develop a systematic process that will identify these patient barriers and assist their care providers in accessing community resources to address them.   4) Conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to monitor for reduction in delays in cancer care among Black, non-Hispanic women in Boston. The Coalition will lead implementation of the identified best practices for the three tools across the Boston health systems and track improvements in care delivery.	Our study is powered on the clinical effectiveness outcome. Our primary study outcome is Time to initiation of cancer treatment, a continuous outcome defined as the number of days from diagnosis (Time 0) to treatment initiation (Time 1). Treatment initiation is defined as the time from biopsy until first treatment for cancer, either surgical, radiation, or systemic therapy. Table 2 displays the specific data elements that will be used to define treatment initiation. As some patients have had pre-operative chemotherapy or hormone therapy, the time period will vary for each patient. This outcome has been widely used in existing navigation studies, as it has been linked to mortality and survival outcomes.         Table 2.

Exclusion criteria include:  1. cancer diagnosis made > 60 days prior to enrollment, such that the ability of the intervention to effect the outcome is limited; 2. presence of a cognitive impairment such as dementia or delirium from any cause (e.g. metabolic, medication or drug induced), given the unique challenges to their treatment decision making/ adherence and the fact that the intervention would not include the patient directly, but rather the family; 3. home residence is outside of the city of Boston, Massachusetts.	Not provided.	The intervention includes three distinct components:  1. A real time patient registry that is shared across the six health systems. The registry will be built using the HIPAA compliant REDCap platform and function as a 'tickler file' embedded into the navigator workflow. This navigator tool provides an automated process that prioritizes the navigator's caseload, and directs them with an actionable list of patients with pending clinical encounters. Sharing navigation process data across the health systems will address known fragmentation in care that leads to delays in treatment.  2. A systematic screening and referral system to identify and address HRSNs. The screening/referral system will be built using the HelpSteps platform. At baseline, 3 and 6 months women in the intervention arm are asked to identify needs categorized into 15 social domains described in the Research Strategy. Women will be asked to pick the two most pressing domains and then will be asked a series of questions to identify the precise services needed for each domain. These data will be available and stored in the registry for use by the patient navigators. At each contact, the navigator will check on the status of referrals and assess whether a woman would like to receive additional referrals from similar or different domains. 3. Patient Navigation services following standard operating procedures that are guided by the Principles of Care Management in collaboration with a network of navigators across the six health systems. This includes: a) identifying women eligible for navigation services; b) identifying barriers to engaging in timely cancer care services, with a particular emphasis on social barriers; c) providing assistance to address these barriers through local and regional resources; and, finally, d) tracking women over time across the participating clinical sites to ensure they complete their entire course of cancer care. The innovation here is the integrated network of navigation across regional health systems.	Not provided.	Not provided.	\N	The primary analyses will address delays in receipt of four specific types of therapies from time of diagnosis: 1) dates of surgery - initial and final surgical procedures, 2) dates of chemotherapy - initial data, final dates, and percentage of recommended dosages achieved, 3) dates of radiation therapy - initial and final dates of service, proportion of fractions delivered, and 4) dates of hormonal therapy initiation and adherence.       We will conduct an Observational Stepped Wedge Design, where the intervention is rolled out in a staggered manner over time, in groups of experimental units, so that as time goes on, more and more units experience the intervention. By the end, all units experience the intervention.	As this is a health system level intervention, all eligible women will receive the intervention. Navigator protocols will include tailored Workflow maps that specify how each navigator will identify newly diagnosed breast cancer cases who meet our eligibility criteria within each of the six clinical sites. The clinical site PIs will provide oversight to ensure all cases are enrolled to receive the navigation delivered intervention. We expect every eligible patient to be enrolled, as the TRIP intervention will be implemented as a standard of care at each participating site.
399	2018-09-11	55	\N	t	"Sickle Cell Disease Treatment with Arginine Therapy (STArT) trial"	STArT Trial	4	Vaso-occlusive painful episodes (VOE) in sickle cell disease (SCD) are the leading cause of hospitalizations, emergency room (ED) visits, missed school, & are associated with an increased mortality rate.  There are no current therapies to relieve vaso-occlusion, with interventions limited to hydration and analgesia. Nitric oxide (NO), produced by the 5-electron oxidation of L-arginine, is a potent vasodilator & exerts pleiotropic effects on vascular & circulating blood cells, including the inhibition of platelet aggregation, down-regulation of adhesion molecules, & modulation of ischemia-reperfusion injury, all pathways adversely affected during VOE.  We have found that pediatric SCD patients admitted with VOE have depleted plasma L-arginine levels. Additionally, we have now completed a single-center randomize, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of arginine therapy in 54 children with VOE requiring hospitalization. We observed a reduction in total opioid use (mg/kg) by 54% and significantly lower pain scores at discharge in children who received 5 days IV L-arginine therapy every 8 hours  compared to placebo, as well as a clinically relevant trend in reduced length of hospital stay of approximately 17 hours. In pharmacokinetic studies, we found that IV arginine induced a dose-dependent improvement in mitochondrial function in children with SCD hospitalized for pain. We now propose to extend these results to a pivotal phase 3 trial of L-arginine for VOE.  \n\nStudy Hypothesis: We hypothesize that arginine is a safe intervention with narcotic-sparing effects in pediatric SCD patients with VOE that will decrease the time children experience severe pain.  Aim 1 of this study will determine the efficacy of IV arginine therapy on the primary endpoint, time-to-crisis resolution, as well as total parenteral opioid use (mg/kg) and pain scores in children with SCD & VOE compared to placebo (Efficacy).  Aim 2 will monitor for safety of IV L-arginine (Safety). Aim 3 will characterize alterations in the arginine metabolome and mitochondrial function in children with SCD and VOE, and evaluate how it is impacted by IV arginine therapy (Exploratory). This proposal will provide essential data for product development and FDA regulatory approval for use of arginine in SCD.  Acute care of patients with SCD & pain in the ED is a neglected area of research. The results of this study may ultimately lead to change in clinical practice for children with SCD in both the ED & inpatient hospital wards. ED-based studies and novel therapies that target mechanisms of vaso-occlusion and pain are needed in SCD.	This is a Phase 3, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of IV arginine to treat children with sickle cell disease and vasoocclusive pain. This is a 2-arm study: L-arginine IV Q8 hours compared to placebo.	Specific Aim 1: Efficacy \n\nTo determine the efficacy of intravenous (IV) arginine, when added to standard therapy, on the time-to-crisis resolution in children with SCD and VOE compared to placebo. Important secondary outcomes include  length of hospital stay, total parenteral opioid use (mg/kg morphine equivalents), pain scores, discharge rate from the emergency department, and health-related quality of life outcomes of children with SCD presenting with VOE. \n\nAim 2: Safety\n\nTo determine the safety profile of IV L-arginine in the treatment of acute VOE in children with SCD. In particular, renal and hepatic function will be monitored, together with rate of acute chest syndrome, requirement for blood transfusion, oxygen use during study drug delivery, and 72-hour and 28-day return visits to the emergency department or hospital admission.  \n\nAim 3: Exploratory \n\nTo further characterize alterations in the arginine metabolome and mitochondrial dysfunction in children with SCD and VOE, and evaluate how it is impacted by arginine therapy. This aim will also establish a SCD-VOE biorepository to explore future mechanistic studies.

Morris MD (IND sponsor).	60 months	~ 1 month (randomized treatment during hospital admission, and 28-day follow up)	Parenteral L-arginine HCL is only made by 1 Biopharma company: Pfizer.  The lead PI,  Dr. Claudia R. Morris MD has been a consultant for Pfizer since 2014, where she is the chair of an acute chest syndrome adjudication committee for an on-going phase 3 trial run by Pfizer for an unrelated study drug.  The Emory COI office is aware and has this under "case management" and has determined there is no conflict.	Sample Size and Statistical Analysis :  \nOver a 1-year period, >3600 visits to the Arginine/PECARN Network EDs (Table 1) were recorded for children with SCD presenting for acute management of VOE. There is more than sufficient access to an eligible patient population due to the large volume of patients receiving care through the PECARN network and Emory/CHOA. \n \nAlthough we saw a trend towards decreased LOS, the Morris 2013 study was not sufficiently powered to identify a statistically significant difference.  Patients were consented within 24 hours of ED arrival, with mean time to study drug delivery of ~20 hours. Despite this delay, a trend towards decreased LOS, & a significant decrease in opioid use is observed in the arginine arm.  Therefore, a more rapid initiation of arginine therapy after ED presentation, added to standard pain management may increase the detectable mean difference in LOS between the treatment and placebo arms.  This study will be sufficiently powered to detect a clinically significant decrease in LOS (as a surrogate for time-to-crisis-resolution). Total opioid use correlated strongly to LOS (r=0.86, p<0.0001). LOS strongly correlates to time-to-crisis-resolution (r=0.93, p<0.0001; Greg Kato unpublished data from DeNOVO trial, personal communication). Including interim analysis sample size inflammation & drop-out rate of 10%, the multi-center clinical trial will require enrollment of 360 children total with VOE. From 20 sites included in the R34 feasibility study33, 10 sites evaluating >3600 episodes of SCD-VOE annually were identified based on SCD-patient volume and adherence to the 2014 NHLBI guidelines (Table 3).\n\n \nTable 1:  Arginine/PECARN Network proposed sites annual volume and admission rate for SCD-VOE ED visits\nSite Volume\tAdmission Rate\t      Name\n616\t                        81%\t         Children's Hospital of Philadelphia \n602\t                        51%\t         Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston \n432\t                        63%\t         Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of Medicine \n393\t                        57%\t          Children's National Medical Center \n299\t                        46%\t          Children's Hospital of Wisconsin / Medical College of Wisconsin \n289\t                        68%\t           Washington University School of Med / St. Louis Children's Hosp \n258\t                        78%\t           Nationwide Children's Hospital \n247\t                        70%\t           Boston Children's Hospital\n219\t                        65%\t           University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center \n216\t                        65%\t           Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center \n\nData analysis for the study will include sociodemographic (e g, age, sex, race) & medical characteristics of the population enrolled.

A pilot trial completed early in 2015 examined the combination pharmacotherapy naltrexone plus bupropion for MA use disorder in an open-label design (Mooney et al., 2016) and found a signal sufficient to advise the development of a fully powered, placebo-controlled study to test this combination. As a result, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of extended-release naltrexone plus bupropion as a combination pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine use disorder. The Active Medication Combination (AMC) arm, which includes injectable naltrexone plus once daily oral bupropion will be compared to a matched placebo (PLB) arm, in individuals with moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder seeking to stop or reduce methamphetamine use. The primary analysis will evaluate the impact of the AMC arm, relative to PLB, on methamphetamine use. The primary efficacy outcome is a measurement of treatment response based on methamphetamine negative urine drug screen results during the medication phase. It is hypothesized that the AMC arm will be associated with a greater number of 'responders,' defined as participants who provide a pre-specified number of MA-negative urine drug screen tests during the evaluation period of the 12 week long medication phase, relative to the PLB arm.	There will be 370 individuals randomized into the study across 7 clinical sites. Eligibility will be determined during a maximum 21 day screening period. To document an appropriate level of current methamphetamine use, prospective participants must submit at least two urine samples positive for methamphetamine of a possible three tests to occur within a 10 day period during which clinic visits occur with at least two days between visits. In addition, participants must self-report MA use on 18 or more days in the 30 day period prior to consent using the Timeline Followback (TLFB) and meet diagnostic criteria for moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder per DSM-5 (4 or more criteria) at screening. After screening is completed and eligibility is confirmed, including successful administration of a naloxone challenge, participants will begin the 12 week medication phase of the trial. Participants will be randomized to either the 1) AMC arm and receive injections of extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX; as Vivitrol�) plus once-daily oral extended-release bupropion tablets (BUP-XL) or the 2) matching placebo (PLB) arm and receive injections of placebo (iPLB) plus once-daily oral placebo (oPLB) tablets. This protocol will utilize a sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD), originally proposed by Fava et al. (2003), and later revised by Chen et al. (2011). A feature of this design is that it can reduce the overall placebo response rate. One advantage of the adaptive aspect of the design is that it requires a smaller sample size compared to a standard two group randomized trial design. During the course of the study, participants may be switched to another arm, as determined by the a priori adaptive aspect of the study design. Participants appearing to respond well to their original treatment assignment will not be switched. Overall, approximately 50% of the participants will receive the AMC. Injections will be administered every three weeks, in weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Take-home oral study medication (BUP-XL or oPLB) will be dispensed weekly for dosing on non-clinic days. Participants will be asked to attend the clinic twice weekly for observed oral medication dosing, assessments, collection of urine samples, and once-weekly medical management. On non-clinic days, participants will participate in smartphone app-based medication adherence activities. Participants will be asked to complete assessments as indicated on the schedule of assessments. Following the 12 week medication phase, participants will complete a follow-up phase, including a medication taper and post-medication phase follow-up visits during weeks 13 and 16.	The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the AMC arm, compared to a matched placebo (PLB) arm, in reducing methamphetamine use in individuals with moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder seeking to stop or reduce methamphetamine use. The primary analysis will evaluate the impact of the AMC arm, relative to PLB, on methamphetamine use. The primary efficacy outcome is a measurement of treatment response based on methamphetamine negative urine drug screen results during the medication phase. It is hypothesized that the AMC arm will be associated with a greater number of 'responders,' defined as participants who provide a pre-specified number of MA-negative UDS tests during the evaluation period of the 12 week long medication phase, relative to the PLB arm. Secondary objectives include evaluating the effect of the AMC arm, compared to the PLB arm, on safety, other substance use outcomes, depression scores, quality of life, overall functioning, clinic attendance, and medication adherence. Please see protocol (attached) for specific outcomes/endpoints for each Specific Aim.	The primary efficacy outcome measure is a composite of MA-negative urine drug screen test results during the medication phase and will be compared by treatment group (AMC versus PLB).	1	Inclusion: 18 to 65 years  old; Interested in reducing/stopping methamphetamine use; Speak English; meet DSM-5 criteria for moderate/severe methamphetamine use disorder; Self-report methamphetamine use ? 18 days in the 30 day period prior to consent;  Provide at least 2 (out of 3) urine samples positive for methamphetamine during screening; If female of childbearing potential, agree to use acceptable birth control methods and have periodic urine pregnancy testing unless documented hysterectomy; Meet subjective and objective measures of being opioid-free prior to naltrexone induction, including passing naloxone challenge; Willing to comply with all study procedures and medication instructions; Agree to use a cell phone to record videos of medication dosing.

Not provided.	The study intervention consists of 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy, medical management, and medication adherence procedures. Participants randomized to the AMC treatment arm will receive an injection of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; as Vivitrol�) plus 450 mg of once-daily oral extended-release bupropion tablets (BUP-XL). Participants randomized to the PLB treatment arm will receive matched placebo in the form of injections of placebo (iPLB) plus once-daily oral placebo (oPLB) tablets. Injections of study medications (XR-NTX or iPLB) will be administered in weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Study medical clinicians will provide weekly medical management. A free medication adherence app will be provided to participants to provide study visit reminders, reminders to take study medication, and to take self-dosing videos of the oral study medication.

Hersh Chair for Depression Research and Clinical Care who is the Lead PI of the CTN-0068 ADAPT-2 multi-site study has a financial interest in Alkermes, Inc., the maker of Vivitrol�. He has previously received funds from them for consulting, advisory, or speaking services.	The primary efficacy outcome measure is MA-negative urine drug screen (UDS) test results over the course of twice-weekly visits, which will be compared by treatment group (AMC versus PLB). Participants will be defined as a 'responder' if there are at least 75% MA-negative UDS tests during the pre-specified evaluation period. The treatment groups will be compared as to the proportion of responders using a Z test. All treatment comparisons will be performed under the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) criteria. The sample size calculation for our study was conducted as described in Tamura (2007). Various assumptions on the sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD) parameters of the randomization fraction, a and the weight, w and the sample size for the study were evaluated. When the rate of discontinuation is 0% (s=1), the sample size calculation based on Tamura and Huang (2007) gives the same results as Fava et al.'s (2003) SPCD sample size calculations. We assume p1=0.24 (response rates for AMC) and q1=0.10 to 0.15 (response rates for PLB), and s=.85 (rate of continuation). Corresponding to these, the randomization fraction a=.37 and the weight w=0.43 would maximize the power of the test. A sample size of 370 is chosen for this study and will provide 90% power to detect the weighted difference between the two treatment arms.	We expect recruitment to be challenging due to some of the clinical correlates of methamphetamine use, for example, paranoia and medical problems, that will limit the pool of interested and eligible individuals, respectively. Recruitment is expected to begin on 03/01/2017 and last approximately 18 months. Each of the seven study sites is expected to randomize at least 3 participants each month. In a pilot study with similar inclusion/exclusion criteria, 49 participants were enrolled over 12 months: on average for every 9 people pre-screened, 4 passed and scheduled a consent visit, 2 attended the consent visit, and 1 was eligible to be enrolled. Study participants will be recruited using a variety of methods including flyers, mailers, billboards, television, radio, internet, social networking, and study-branded materials (e.g., ink pens, post-it notes) as well as advertising in print, electronic, and/or digital newspapers. Mailings will be sent to community agencies whose partnerships will be key to participant recruitment and retention. Secondary recruitment efforts will be targeted at the families, friends, and providers of people who use methamphetamine. The study sites should attract a diverse study population. Efforts will be made to recruit a study sample that reflects, or exceeds, the proportion of minorities in the community where the site is located. Recruitment procedures aiming to enhance enrollment of women and/or minorities will be conducted, including linkages with medical sites and/or treatment programs that serve a large number of women and/or minorities, and advertising in media outlets with high female/minority audience. Participants will not receive other formal addiction treatment services while they are participating in the study. Thus, participants must be willing to have the study intervention serve as their sole treatment during study participation. Mutual help support group attendance will be encouraged throughout the trial. Upon study completion, participants may enroll in behavioral or pharmacological addiction treatment services.
159	2017-06-21	25	\N	\N	Comparing Invasive vs. Noninvasive Evaluation and Management of Angina - The CINEMA Trial	CINEMA	6	CINEMA proposes to randomize 4,758 patients with symptoms suggestive of stable coronary heart disease referred for cardiac catheterization to a noninvasive evaluation and management strategy using cardiac CT vs. the current standard of invasive angiography. The CT based algorithm will restrict coronary revascularization to patients with high-risk coronary anatomy. Patients will be followed for at least three years for the outcomes of procedure related injuries and a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. We hypothesize that the noninvasive evaluation and management strategy will lead to fewer patient injuries and lower costs without excess risk in adverse cardiac events.	CINEMA will use a non-blinded, parallel-group, clinical trial comparing the experimental non-invasive evaluation and management strategy to the current strategy. Randomization will occur in simple 1:1 fashion using a computer generated permuted block design and stratified by site. Patients randomized to the experimental strategy will undergo coronary CT angiography instead of cardiac catheterization and proceed only to revascularization with high-risk coronary anatomy. Patients randomized to the invasive strategy will undergo cardiac catheterization and invasive coronary angiography as planned. Angiography results will be evaluated by the clinical team at the study site and management will be implemented according to local practice.	Our study has the following Specific Aims:   1.\tTest the hypothesis that among patients with suspected, stable coronary heart disease (CHD), a non-invasive evaluation and management strategy using cardiac CT imaging (NEM) is superior to the conventional, invasive strategy (CEM) for the outcome of patient injury (primary outcome #1), defined by the three-year rate of the composite outcome of myocardial injury, kidney injury, major bleeding, or vascular injury.    2.\tDetermine the difference between the two strategies in the three-year rates of the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (primary outcome #2) with precision of �1.4%,( 95% confidence interval), that is equivalent to �0.46 events per 100 person years.     3.\tTest the hypothesis that among patients with suspected, stable CHD, a non-invasive evaluation and management strategy using cardiac CT imaging (NEM) is superior to the conventional, invasive strategy (CEM) in direct and indirect three-year costs (main secondary outcome).     Other secondary study aims evaluate difference between the NEM and CEM strategies in each of the following outcome measures: rate and length of hospitalizations, angina control, quality of life, patient satisfaction and preferences, revascularization procedures, and incidence of heart failure. Pre-specified subprojects include investigations of clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics for identifying patients benefitting from revascularization, the impact of anatomic vs. physiologic noninvasive assessment for patient management and outcome, and operator and study site characteristics for predicting patient outcome.	1.\tPrimary Outcome #1 (Injury Outcome) is defined by the three-year rate of the composite outcome of myocardial injury, kidney injury, major bleeding, or vascular injury.  2.\tPrimary Outcome #2 (Adverse Events) is defined by the three-year rate of the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.  3.\tMain Secondary Outcome (cost outcome) is defined by the three-year direct and indirect three-year costs.	1	Our study population will include patients 18 years and older with stable angina pectoris or equivalent angina symptoms who have been referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of CHD. These patients have been evaluated/tested by physicians who view the probability and severity of CHD sufficiently high to warrant invasive evaluation (AHA/ACC class I or IIa indication for invasive coronary angiography). Patients with prior history of CHD will be included. By standard criteria, these patients will be of intermediate to high pretest probability of obstructive CHD. Patients will be excluded from participation if they have a history of anaphylactic reactions to iodine contrast, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, severe heart failure, suspected or recent acute coronary syndrome, or planned major surgery necessitating interruption of antiplatelet therapy.	60-70 US medical centers will be asked to participate. Each center has access to 5-6 additional recruitment sites.	CINEMA tests a specific evaluation and management strategy in patients with suspected, stable coronary heart disease which restricts invasive procedures and coronary artery revascularization to patients with high-risk features. Otherwise, patients will be assigned to risk factor modification and medical management.	Study duration will be seven years.	Patients will be followed for at least 36 months post enrollment.	Nothing to disclose.	The precision margin of �1.4% (�0.46 events per 100 person years) was chosen after careful consideration of numerous factors. High precision must be weighed against practicality and cost concerns as well as desired study impact on clinical practice. We believe the chosen margin will provide convincing evidence to researchers and clinicians to alleviate concerns about excess risk of severe adverse events with NEM-particularly, given substantial supporting data applicable from medical treatment vs. PCI in patients with stable CHD. Furthermore, the anticipated large difference in the composite injury outcome is expected to favor NEM, even in the setting of a difference between the two strategies close to the pre-specified margin. Importantly, the selected precision margin reflects the fact that we used conservative assumptions for anticipated event rates as well as for the presumed zero difference between the two groups. Given available data, it is not unreasonable to assume lower risk of the composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke for NEM in which case study precision will further increase. Should-against our expectations-greater precision be required, collaborative efforts and meta-analyses built on the foundation we provide will allow a more precise estimate of differences between the two strategies.   \nData Analysis: Corresponding to the randomization, the primary analysis for the injury outcome will be by marginal logistic regression in which the parameter of interest is the ratio of the log odds of injury comparing persons in the NEM to those in the CEM arm. Possible clustering of the events within each of the site centers will be accounted for using Generalized Estimating Functions (GEE; Liang and Zeger, 1986); however, we expect clustering to be negligible because of the design for balanced randomization within each center.  As a secondary analysis, time to events will be taken into account using discrete survival analysis with 6-month intervals to take account of changes in the rate of events over the 3 years of follow-up. As a secondary analysis, we will test for a trend in the treatment log odds ratio with follow-up time. For the adverse event outcome, a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio of the treatment effect, as well as the unadjusted rate difference between the two event rates will be constructed using the same GEE approach.   \nIn addition to injury and event outcomes (Specific Aims 1 and 2), health status measures, resource utilization and costs will be measured (Specific Aim 3).  The health status measures will include the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the SF-12 and the EQ-5D, the latter for assessment of utility.  Resource utilization for the initial procedure, and follow-up costs will be estimated, based largely on Medicare payment schedules and Redbook wholesale acquisition costs.  Indirect costs are difficult to measure but to be included.  Survival will be estimated from Census survival estimates as well as available databases.  This will permit the estimation of quality adjusted life years.  The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be determined, as well as its distribution in the cost-effectiveness plane and with cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.  A probabilistic sensitivity analysis will allow for assessment of the distribution of the ICER.  Societal impact of expected decrease in PCI procedures, but on cost and clinical outcomes, will be estimated based on incident rates of PCI and complications as noted in the clinical literature and from existing databases.	Recruitment feasibility is of utmost importance for any clinical trial. To explore pathways to improve recruitment efficiency, we propose to collaborate with the NCATS-CTSA program, which may possibly use our trial as a model for improving trial efficiency through a number of innovative interventions. As each CTSA program hub has 5-6 satellite centers each, utilization of all or part of the NCATS TIN network would allow adjustment of recruitment sites according to actual screening yields and demands of the final approved study schedule. For example, a total of more than 100 or even 200 recruitment centers may be employed to enroll patients if enrollment rates are unexpectedly low. Alternatively, EHR cohort identification and NCATS trial innovation methodologies might be capable of an increase recruitment to possibly 4-5 patients per month allowing limiting the number of trial sites to approximately 40 sites. Therefore, an important goal of a collaboration with the NCATS-CTSA program would be to substantially increasing recruitment efficiency to ?2 patients per site/month. Our proposal was discussed with the Cardiology Leadership at the NHLBI who were very enthusiastic about a collaboration with the NCATS-CTSA program in support of CINEMA.   \nWe view site development as key to successful recruitment and we are planning for intensive efforts in this regard. Specifically, stakeholders, including administrators, patients, general practitioners, general cardiologists, and interventional cardiologists, at each site center will be engaged to solicit involvement and by-in for the trial. The goal for this engagement is to develop a consensus among stakeholders on an algorithm/policy for patient recruitment at each site that greatly enhances recruitment efficiency. The demonstrated academic interests of selected centers could be ideally suited to translate efficiency efforts into practice.   \nPast experience, particularly with the ISCHEMIA trial, has raised concerns about institutional equipoise among recruitment centers, particularly, in the US. An important advantage of CINEMA-if our hypotheses are confirmed-are the expected very large cost savings due to approximately 50% fewer catheterizations and revascularization procedures. Given recent developments in the health services reimbursement structure, which include a strong trend of abandoning the fee-for-service model and moving towards bundled payments and capitation, there are clear incentives for healthcare systems to focus on lower expenses associated with the same medical conditions.  CINEMA is closely aligned with this paradigm and thus will be very attractive to US medical institutions, which in turn will generate support for our recruitment efforts. Therefore, our study design and the timely study potential of CINEMA will be ideally suited to meet or exceed our recruitment goals.
269	2018-01-23	55	\N	\N	Non-Operative Management of Pediatric Appendicitis: A Randomized Controlled Study	APPEND-X	3	This is a study of non-operative vs. surgical management of acute, uncomplicated pediatric appendicitis.  Eligible patients will be randomized to either initial treatment with antibiotics only (2 doses of intravenous piperacillin-tazobactom; if clinically improved after 12 hours of in-patient observation, discharge on 1 week of either ciprofloxicin/metronidazole or cefixime/amoxicillin-clavulanate) or urgent laparoscopic appendectomy.  We hypothesize that non-operative management, compared to urgent appendectomy, will result in: a) a lower major and minor complication rate; and b) better health utility and lower health costs.  We also hypothesize that clinical and/or diagnostic testing predictors of non-operative management outcomes will be identified.	The primary purpose of this phase 2B study is to determine the safety (complication rate), efficacy (appendectomy free rate), and health utility and cost of non-operative management (initial treatment with antibiotics only) of acute, uncomplicated pediatric appendicitis, vs. urgent appendectomy.  Participants will be randomized, with equal assignment, to one of these two study arms.  As it would be unethical to perform sham surgeries, this is an unblinded study. Participants, treating clinicians, and study personnel will be aware of study arm assignment.  All participants will be assessed at 1, 2 and 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months, for the above mentioned study outcomes.  There will be annual follow-up beyond 24 months, for participants enrolled early in the study.\n\nA secondary, exploratory aim of this study is to determine the ability of clinical and diagnostic testing factors to predict study outcomes.	Specific Aim 1: Determine the major complication rate at 30 days of non-operative management of acute appendicitis in children. Secondary outcomes are the incidence of major and minor complications in each treatment arm at 2 years, and the percentage of participants who are appendectomy-free at 6 months and 2 years. We hypothesize that non-operative management will have a significantly lower complication rate and that 70% of these patients will be appendectomy free at 2 year follow-up.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Determine the overall health utility and cost of non-operative management of acute appendicitis in children, compared with urgent appendectomy. We hypothesize that non-operative management of children with acute appendicitis will result in significantly better health utility and lower cost than urgent appendectomy..\n\nSpecific Aim 3: Identification of one or more predictors of failure of non-operative treatment, or recurrence of appendicitis after successful non-operative treatment.	The primary endpoint is the incidence of major complications at 30-day follow-up in the two study arms.  Secondary endpoints include: a) 6 and 24 month incidence of major and minor complications; b) 6 and 24 month appendectomy free rate in the non-operative management arm; c) health utility and costs of non-operative management compared to urgent appendectomy at 24 month follow-up; and d) identification of clinical and/or diagnostic testing factor(s) which predict study outcomes.	2	Inclusion criteria:\n   - Age 5-18 years\n   - Less than 48 hour history of abdominal pain\n   - Right lower quadrant tenderness\n   - At at least one of the following: \n        Fever, Migratory pain, Nausea or vomiting, Rebound-tenderness at McBurney's point, Rovsing sign, Obturator sign, \n        Psoas sign\n   - Imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) diagnosis of acute appendicitis\n\nExclusion criteria:\n   - Inability to provide informed consent\n   - Inability to take oral medication\n   - Unavailable to be contacted and for follow-up for the duration of the study\n   - Allergy to study medications\n   - Antibiotics administration prior to study enrollment\n   - Clinical or imaging suspicion of advanced appendicitis\n   - Imaging criteria of perforated appendicitis\n   - Significant and/or unstable medical co-morbidities or other conditions, including unstable diabetes mellitus, unstable\n     cystic fibrosis, unstable asthma, unstable underlying gastrointestinal conditions, neurologic conditions that alter pain\n     perception, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, known pregnancy at the time of presentation \n   - Inability to understand English or Spanish\n   - "Open" (non-laparoscopic) appendectomy (participant- or surgeon-preference)	Eight children's hospitals across the US -- Providence, RI; Boston, MA; New York, NY; Philadelphia, PA; Wilmington, DE; Houston, TX; Albuquerque, NM; and Davis, CA.	Non-operative management will consist of:\n   -Two doses of intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam 6 hours apart, followed by\n   -one week of oral antibiotics, ciprofloxicin (twice a day) and metronidazole (three times a day); participants who are unable\n    to tolerate these oral antibiotics, will be offered cefixime (twice a day) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (three times a day).	57 months.	Minimum 24 months, up to 48 months for participants enrolled early in the study.	None.	The primary endpoint of this study is the occurrence of complications from non-operative management and urgent appendectomy at 30 days. The unit of analysis for this aim are individual participants, not the total number or severity of complications. The rationale for this choice is the likely outcome of this study. Based on the published pediatric and adult studies, we anticipate a low rate (3-6%) of 30-day major complications among urgent appendectomy participants, and an even lower rate (1.1%) among the non-operative management group, with both groups experiencing similar types and severity of complications. Given this, the most clinically meaningful and important comparison is how many patients in each treatment arm experience a major complication. \n\nWhile number of participants experiencing a complication will be the primary endpoint, all complications are important and will be reported. If unusual patterns of complications, either type, severity, or frequency are detected in the primary analyses, they will be investigated with detailed secondary analyses.\n\nDescriptive statistics of study outcomes will report percentages for categorical variables, and means with standard deviations, median, quartiles, and range for continuous data. Checks of assumptions (e.g., normality) of underlying statistical procedures will be performed and corrective procedures applied if needed.\n\nA Mantel-Haenszel statistic, assessing the effect of intervention on primary outcome controlling for site, will be calculated to test the hypothesis of no difference. It is expected that, for both the final analyses as well as interim analyses, the asymptotic version of the Mantel-Haenszel test will be appropriate. In the case of low outcome counts, a stratified exact score test will be carried out. Specifically, a logistic model will be fit where treatment factor level predicts primary outcome, conditional on stratum, and an exact significance test will be used. A two-sided significance level of 0.05 will be used. Major complications in each treatment arm will be summarized as a proportion, and the observed treatment effect will be reported as a relative risk or an odds ratio, with a corresponding 95% confidence interval.\n\nAs we expect some missing outcome data, we will use multiple imputation techniques to perform an intention-to-treat analysis and include all possible study subjects in the analyses. We will generate five imputed datasets by fully conditional expectation, using backward selection to choose sufficiently predictive models for each variable given the others. Models will be constrained to include treatment arm. Although such an approach will rely on an assumption of missingness at random and accuracy of the models used, this method is fairly robust.  We will also perform complete-case analyses and other sensitivity analyses to assess whether the results are robust. Subjects who withdraw from the study will have all data that are accrued up until the time of withdrawal included in the analysis.\n\nEndpoints at 6 months and 2 years constitute the secondary outcome measures of this study. They include the major- and minor complication rates and the appendectomy-free rate. The minor complication outcome will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary outcome. The success rate of initial non-operative treatment (the percentage of participants who are appendectomy-free at 6 months and 2 years) will be calculated with a corresponding 95% confidence interval. Overall health utility will be compared between treatment groups using a Van Elteren test, stratified by site. The results will be presented using summary statistics for each treatment group (mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range). These secondary outcomes will each be allocated a significance level of 0.025 to adjust for multiple comparisons.	Consecutive, eligible patients at the 8 participating sites will be approached for the study. We anticipate 3-6 months to activate all sites. The sites vary in their volume of appendicitis patients; we anticipate a low volume site enrolling 2-3 participants per month, vs. a high volume site enrolling 10-12 participants per month.  We anticipate 34-38 months to enroll our study sample; this estimate is based on pooled enrollment data from 10 pediatric pilot studies of this topic.
31	2016-11-25	5	\N	\N	Zoster Eye Disease Study (ZEDS): A multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial of valacyclovir in immunocompetent subjects with an episode of dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis, and/or iritis due to Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO) in the year prior to enrollment.	ZEDS study	\N	The primary objective is to evaluate whether or not prolonged suppressive oral antiviral treatment with valacyclovir reduces complications of HZO including new or worsening dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis, and/or iritis and/or postherpetic neuralgia compared to placebo.	The study is a double-masked, multi-center RCT that will enroll immunocompetent study participants age 18 years and older who have HZO diagnosed at variable times in the past, with an episode of dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis, and/or iritis within one year of enrollment. Eligible study participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to long-term suppressive treatment with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily or placebo for one year, and followed every 3 months for a total of 18 months, to determine outcomes of new or worsening anterior segment ocular disease (e.g. dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis, and/or iritis) and/or severity and duration of postherpetic neuralgia during 12 months of treatment and for 6 months following treatment discontinuation. Within each center, participants will be randomized within four strata, defined by age at onset of HZO (less than 60 years or 60 years and greater) and by recent onset or chronic HZO (recent onset defined as HZO diagnosed within 6 months of enrollment/ randomization, or chronic defined as HZO diagnosed 6 months or more prior to enrollment/randomization).    A table of visits and required assessments is attached (attachment #2 - Schedule of Events).	Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that long-term suppressive antiviral therapy can reduce complications of HZO by conducting a double-masked, placebo-controlled randomized trial of oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily. Specifically, we will evaluate whether or not long term suppressive antiviral therapy compared with placebo therapy will delay the time to the first occurrence of new or worsening dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis, and/or iritis compared to placebo, by 12 months (primary endpoint), and whether or not that treatment effect persists 6 months after cessation of treatment by 18 months (secondary endpoint) in immunocompetent patients with HZO who have a history of one of these disease manifestations within the year prior to enrollment. The primary endpoint is measured by the time to first occurrence of any one of these specified complications.         Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that suppressive treatment for 12 months with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily reduces the incidence, severity and duration of post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) compared to placebo at 12 and 18 months (secondary objectives) in patients with HZO. Given evidence that active VZV infection contributes to PHN, and the lack of effective and well tolerated treatment for PHN, it is important to prospectively collect data to study the efficacy of suppressive antiviral treatment for this extremely painful and debilitating condition that negatively impacts quality of life, especially in the elderly.  The results with regard to PHN may be generalizable to HZ in other anatomic locations; PHN lasts more than a year in nearly half of patients older than age 70, reduces quality of life in direct proportion to the severity and duration of pain, and more than quadruples the one year costs of the disease.

Not provided	Eligible study participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to suppressive treatment with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily or placebo for one year.  Study participants will be followed every 3 months for a total of 18 months, 6 months following completion of the 12 month treatment period.  Study participants will be instructed to take 2 pills once daily in the morning.         Use of Divided Dose of Study Medication for Intolerance    If the study participant has mild to moderate side effects to the study medication, the medication will be temporarily discontinued, and when side effects resolve, the study participant may resume the study medication in divided doses, taking one pill twice daily, instead of two pills once daily, as it may be better tolerated.         Use of Reduced Dose of Study Medication for Intolerance    If the study participant has mild to moderate side effects to the study medicine when taken in divided doses, the medication will be temporarily discontinued, and when side effects resolve, the study participant may resume the study medication at a reduced dose of one capsule daily.         Discontinuation of Study Medication due to Intolerance    If intolerance to the study medication is moderate or worse after restarting the study medication in divided doses and reducing the dose, the study medication will be permanently discontinued. The study participant will be treated at the discretion of ophthalmologists involved in their care, and continue to be followed.  Open label use of other antivirals after study medication is discontinued will be collected and monitored.         Discontinuation of Study Medication    If the study participant develops a contraindication to valacyclovir (e.g., an exclusion criterion) during the course of the study (See 4.2.), the study medication will be permanently discontinued and the study participant will continue to be followed.	Not provided	Not provided	\N	Please refer to section 10 of the attached protocol (attachment #1)	Major factors in the anticipated success of ZEDS are the overall organization and operations support that was developed for clinical centers and the careful selection of clinical centers with an adequate population of eligible HZO patients, experienced clinical center research staff, and the expertise and infrastructure to support human subject research.  Data submitted by 60 clinical centers demonstrate an adequate eligible population.  There are 18 centers that reported treating over 100 HZO patients in 2012 or 2013 (mean 186/year), 17 centers with 50-99 HZO patients (mean 69/year), 22 centers with 20-49 HZO patients (mean 31/year), and 3 centers that on PCA treated less than 20 patients, but were included to enhance geographic diversity.  We estimate that enrollment of approximately 15% of the HZO patients the centers reported treating will enable fulfillment of enrollment goals. Potentially eligible patients will be identified and referred for participation in the study via a variety of methods.  It is expected that the most widely used strategy will be identification by the clinical center's PI, investigators, cornea fellows, ophthalmology residents, other ophthalmologists, and referring doctors. Many centers will screen medical records on a daily basis upon IRB approval.  Quarterly recruitment metrics will be submitted and compared to the milestone accrual plan registered with NEI at study initiation. If the study fails to achieve the targeted number of enrollments per quarterly metrics corrective action plans will be implemented in stages. Early in the trial timeline delays in site activation may need to be corrected to increase recruitment. The expected accrual period is approximately 36 month plus 12 months treatment and 6 months additional follow-up for last enrolled participant, and 6 month close-out and analysis period. The accrual period is expected to begin early summer 2017 with last subject completing follow-up in early summer 2021.

289	2018-02-28	40	\N	\N	Bone disease in living kidney donors	Bone disease in living kidney donors	6	SCIENTIFIC PREMISE The premise of our study is that following kidney donation, donors will develop reduced bone mineral density and cortical and trabecular bone volume and strength.  Therapy with 1,25(OH)2D3 will correct abnormal skeletal architecture thereby reducing the risk of fractures.\nHYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that a decrease in serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations that occurs as a result of reductions in renal mass and GFR following kidney donation results in secondary hyperparathyroidism (as evidenced by increased serum PTH concentrations) and an increase in bone turnover which contributes to reductions in bone density and strength and an increased risk of fractures.  We further hypothesize that therapy with 1,25(OH)2D will correct the observed secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased bone turnover, thereby reducing the bone loss and the risk of fractures.	AIM 1. To conduct a 4-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in live kidney donors to assess the effects of orally administered 1,25(OH)2D3 on skeletal health. 200 live kidney donors will be randomly assigned to two groups.  Subjects in group 1 (N = 100) will receive will receive 0.25 g/day of 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) and subjects in group 2 (N = 100) will receive a placebo beginning immediately after kidney donation for a period of 4 years.  Skeletal health will be assessed at the time of commencement of the study and at year 4 by measuring areal bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, hip and forearm; skeletal architecture and strength by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and finite element analysis (FEA).  Serum mineral and bone biomarkers will be measured at the commencement of the study and at years 2 and 4.	1.  To assess whether living kidney donation is associated with a decrease in bone mineral density, skeletal micro architecture assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography.\n\n2.  To determine whether the administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 prevents changes in bone mineral density and skeletal micro architecture in subjects who have donated a kidney.	The primary outcome will be the difference in bone mineral density (BMD) between the 1,25(OH)2D3-treated donor and placebo-treated donor groups.  \n\nSecondary outcomes: The main secondary outcome will be cortical bone thickness (Ct.Th, μm) and porosity (%); other secondary outcomes will include trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N, mm-1), thickness (Tb.Th, μm), separation (Tb.Sp, μm), and intraindividual distribution of separation (Tb.Sp.SD, μm).  Again these will be compared between 1,25(OH)2D3-treated donor and placebo-treated donor groups. \n\nSecondary exploratory outcomes will include micro-FEA.	1	Male and female living kidney donors of any age between 30-60 years between 0 and 2 years following kidney donation.  \nInclusion criteria: 1. Male or female live kidney donors; 2. Age 30 to 60 years; 3. Not currently taking 1-hydroxylated vitamin D analog. 4.  Otherwise healthy and free of disease.  Since live kidney donors undergo stringent examination to ensure normal health at the participating institutions, all live kidney donors by definition will be free of disease.  \nExclusion criteria: 1. Exposure to medications known to affect bone metabolism e.g. corticosteroids within the past 3 months.  As noted above, I have kidney donors are selected for their good health.  Therefore, they will be free of disease.  However, we will specifically screen for and exclude the following:  2. Diabetes mellitus, FBG >126 mg/dL; 3. Proteinuria >3 g/24 h; 4. Vasculitis, inflammatory or neurological diseases; 5.  Vascular disease.  6. Active malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma; 7. Heart, lung or liver disease.	Mayo Clinic Rochester\nHennepin County Medical Center\nUniversity of Minnesota Medical Center	Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. Participants will be randomized to groups who will receive therapy for 48 months: Group 1 (Placebo, N = 100), and Group 2 (1,25(OH)2D3, 0.25 g orally once/day; N = 100) using the Simon-Pocock algorithm47  balancing for age, sex and ethnicity. The rationale for the doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 to be used is that 1,25(OH)2D3 has a production rate of 1-2 mcg/ day48,49. 1,25(OH)2D3 production in patients following living kidney donation should be equivalent to that seen in patients with CKD 3-4.  Production is reduced but not zero, and therefore 0.25 mcg/day should provide sufficient or nearly sufficient 1,25(OH)2D3 to normalize or nearly normalize 1,25(OH)2D3 levels. Doses of 0.5-4 mcg/day orally are safely used for treatment of 2o HPT in CKD/ESKD50,51. The placebo and 1,25(OH)2D3 will be prepared in the Research Pharmacy, MCR. Drs. Kumar, Kasiske and Matas and their study coordinators will monitor medication compliance by assessing capsule counts.	4 years	4 years	\N	Primary/Secondary outcomes. The main analysis will compare mean BMD at the spine, total hip and distal forearm between donor placebo and donor 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment groups.  Secondary analyses will examine the difference in cortical and trabecular thickness and bone strength between donor placebo and donor 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment groups. The main analysis will use linear regression to compare bone measures between donor placebo and donor 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment groups controlling for age, sex, and race.  Sub-analyses will investigate whether the differences between donor placebo and donor 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment groups vary by gender, and age, and will also include analyses run separately by gender.  Visual plots as well as spline fits and other diagnostics will be used to assess the fit and possible need for transformations or use of generalized linear models. \nLinear regression analyses will be used to assess the associations of bone biomarker concentrations and hormonal analysis with BMD, cortical and trabecular width, and bone strength assessed by finite element analysis adjusting for age, sex and race.  Differences in the associations between the BMD, cortical and trabecular width, and bone strength and measured serum biomarkers and hormones will be assessed in the two groups and analyses will also be run separately by gender.  \nStatistical analyses will be performed using SAS 9 (SAS Institute), R 3.3 (http://www.R-project.org), SPSS 18.0 software (IBM Corp), and/or MedCalc 15.2.2 (MedCalc; https://www.medcalc.org/) software, or newer, and significance will be assessed at the 0.05 level.	When do you expect the first site to be initiated and how long before all sites are actively recruiting (Months-to-Activate)?  July 2019\n\nIn your estimation, how many subjects will each site enroll, on average, each month that they are open (RND/Site-Month)?\n\nIn the attached table, I show the numbers of living donor transplants performed at each of the 3 sites.  I am assuming that 50 percent of all donors from each site will be you recruited for this trial.  Therefore, at Mayo Clinic Rochester we will recruit approximately 67 patients in year 1 and an equal number in year 2.  At HCMC 5 patients will be recruited in year 1 and 5 patients will be recruited in year 2.  At the University of Minnesota, 40 patients will be recruited in year 1 and 40 patients will be recruited in year 2.  Each year, we hope to recruit about 100 patients.\n\nTable 1.Living donor (LD) kidney transplants performed at Mayo Clinic (MCR), Hennepin County (HCMC) and University of Minnesota Medical Centers (UM) 2017.\n\nYear/Site\t\tMCR\t  HCMC\tUM\t Total  \n\n2017 LD\t          134     11\t 81 \t226\n\t\n\n\n Approximately how long do you think it will take to enroll the planned number of subjects?  We need 200 donors.  One hundred will be recruited in year 1 and 100 will be recruited in year 2.  Thus, it will take us 2 years to complete our recruitment.\n\n Do you have any basis, such as prior study performance data, upon which you based this estimate?  Donors were recruited shortly after donation in the ALTOLD study (AJKD 66:114-124, 2015, Kid Int 90:861-868, 2016)\n\n How important are recruitment efforts to meeting your enrollment goal?  Very important.

297	2018-03-23	55	\N	\N	National Prospective Multicenter Registry of Reproductive Age Women with Disabilities: Pregnancy in Cerebral Palsy and Spina Bifida	Disability and Pregnancy	6	The proportion of US women of reproductive age who have physical, intellectual, developmental, and/or sensory disabilities in increasing due to improved diagnosis and care of the common disorders.  There were multiple gaps in knowledge identified by a multidisciplinary group of experts at an NICHD-sponsored workshop focusing on women with physical disabilities in 2010.  This proposal is to develop a systemic and comprehensive registry of pregnancy course and outcomes among women with physical disabilities.	An ongoing national prospective registry of reproductive age (18-45) women with cerebral palsy and open spina bifidia will be developed using the collaborative multidisciplinary partnership consortium comprising the 5 centers of the National Perinatal Research Consortium (NPRC), other leading US centers caring for pregnant women with disabilities, community organizations including the Cerebral Palsy Foundation, and community members with disabilities in partnership with the NIH Clinical and Translational Sciences Award (CTSA) Centers.  \nA) Using a multi-pronged recruitment strategy (social media, direct advertising internet and public media, direct messaging, crowdsourcing, other registries (NICHD, CDC), community organization) reproductive-aged women with ANY disability will self-register and provide information on patient reported outcomes.\nB) For the initial grant those with spina bifida and cerebral palsy who become pregnant will be followed up for both patient-reported and medical record-based pregnancy and postpartum outcomes.\nOur ultimate goal, with additional funding, is to expand the registry to also study pregnancy and postpartum outcomes of physical and other disabilities.	Specific Aim 1: To develop on ongoing national prospective registry of reproductive age women (18-45)  with physical and other disabilities.\nSpecific Aim 2: To quantify the pregnancy intentions and sexual and reproductive health behaviors and needs, including contraception and STD prevention, of reproductive age women with physical and other disabilities.\nSpecific Aim 3: To determine the incidence and correlates of a) pregnancy and b) selected maternal and perinatal outcomes in the cohort of reproductive age women with CP or spina bifida.\nSpecific Aim 4:  To describe women's perceived need for support systems and audit the adequacy of selected clinician practices during pregnancy and postpartum in women with CP or spina bifida.\nSpecific Aim 5: To archive maternal and newborn (cord) blood from a subset of women with CP and spina bifida in a dedicated biorepository for future funded ancillary investigations of genetic and epigenetic factors that may mediate transmission and severity of CP and spina bifida.	Specific aim 1: Operational registry\nSpecific aim 2: Prevalence of pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use by type of disability\nSpecific aim 3: Incidence of pregnancy and incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in those with CP and Spina bifida\nSpecific aim 4: Types and prevalence of perceived support systems needed; Prevalence of adequate use of evidence-based clinical interventions in women with CP and Spina bifida who become pregnancy\nSpecific aim 5: Adequate operationalization of biospecimen repository. Specific questions to be determined (examples provided in grant) \nThis project will be the implementation of the largest study of pregnancy in women disabilities.  The information generated will be used to tailor future interventions to guide pregnancy decisions and optimize pregnancy timing, outcomes and parenting experiences.  The registry will allow us to address additional questions regarding the frequency and associations with risk factors such as peripartum anxiety, depression, smoking, substance use, intimate partner violence and other stressful life events, and effects of pregnancy on the conditions.	1	Reproductive age (18-45) women with any disability, with efforts more focused on those with physical disability particularly cerebral palsy or open spina bifida.

While stents provide effective scaffolding during treatment of atherosclerotic lesions of the superficial femoral artery (SFA), the most frequent target of such interventions, stents are prone to fracture given the highly dynamic nature of this artery located within a fibromuscular canal and lower limb movements of flexion and extension. Balloon angioplasty however, is not associated with a risk of prosthesis fracture provides limited scaffolding of lesions and plagued with an excess risk of vessel recoil after treatment and subsequent loss of potency. Nevertheless, both stent and balloon technologies have advanced with development of drug (paclitaxel) delivering stents and balloon with improved biomechanical features. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) with these devices have included less complex lesions and patients and have not allowed adjunctive treatments frequently employed in clinical practice with significant clinical and health economic implications. We plan to conduct a real world registry based (RCT) using the ongoing REDCap-based multi center XLPAD Registry (NCT01904851) to test the hypothesis designed to show non-inferiority of non-stent-based therapies to stent based for the primary outcome of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) at 12 months.	The proposed study is a prospective, registry-based, multicenter, single blind (to participant), non-inferiority, randomized parallel arm trial. Following informed consent, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive on a 2:1 basis, either non-stent or stent based therapies, by using the REDCap online randomization system. The treating clinicians will be aware of which treatment the participants are receiving, but the follow-up providers will be blinded to the treatment allocation. Crossover from non-stent to stent-based intervention may occur if stents are used to treat complications arising as a result of non-stent treatments (bail-out indication such as dissection, perforation etc).	The primary efficacy objective is to compare the durability of the non-stent and stent interventions over a 12-month follow-up period, performed in the SFA and proximal popliteal arteries (together termed femoropopliteal or FP) of patients with symptomatic PAD. Secondary efficacy objective is to compare functional status of patients randomly assigned to non-stent vs. stent treatment groups. Another secondary objective will be to compare procedure costs and cost-effectiveness ration for each type of study treatment.\nPrimary safety objectives will be to compare major adverse limb events (MALE) between the study arms. MALE is a composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for acute limb ischemia, need for thrombolysis, thrombectomy, surgical or endovascular intervention or unplanned amputation of the target limb. All-cause mortality will serve as the secondary safety objective. Another secondary objective will be to compare periprocedural complications.	The primary efficacy endpoint is the occurrence of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) at 12 months, which is defined as reintervention within 5 mm proximal or distal to the original treatment segment for 50% or higher angiographic diameter stenosis in the presence of recurrent symptoms within 12-month follow-up. Secondary efficacy endpoints include the walking function by using Walking Impairment Questionnaire scores (scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more difficulty in walking) and the health-related quality of life by using Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire-6 (VascuQoL-6). The VascuQoL-6 will be assessed prior to and at 30-days post-procedure, at the occurrence of CD-TLR and as well as at 12 months if no TLR event occurs within 12 months. Other secondary endpoints include total cumulative procedure cost of non-stent and stent interventions (micro-cost) and cost-effectiveness ratio. \n\nThe primary safety endpoint is the incidence of MALE, defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for acute limb ischemia, need for thrombolysis, thrombectomy, surgical or endovascular intervention or unplanned amputation of the target limb. Secondary safety endpoints are all-cause mortality and peri-procedural complications, including death, major bleeding, access site hematoma >5 cm in diameter, myocardial infarction, stroke, distal embolization, dissection, perforation, stent or vessel thrombosis, repeated endovascular intervention, urgent surgical intervention or any unplanned amputation that occur between the start of the procedure up to discharge post-procedure or 30 days, which ever is shorter.	1	As a registry-based RCT we plan to have broad inclusion/exclusion criteria:\nInclusion criteria:\n1. Age ≥18 years.\n2. Clinically indicated endovascular intervention of the FP artery.\n3. In the judgment of the operator or site investigator the participant is able to comply with routine clinical follow-up.\nExclusion criteria:\n1. According to the judgment of the operator or site investigator the participant has a >12-month life expectancy.\n2. Has other planned procedures or surgery including lower limb revascularization or amputation.	The XLPAD Registry currently has 16 participating U.S. sites. For this RRCT, we plan to include a total of 20 U.S. sites, including 5 new sites that are currently not participating in the XLPAD registry.	The study interventions include medical device interventions in lower extremity peripheral artery:\n1. Stent intervention arm: Allow all clinically indicated adjunctive device interventions during the study procedure with an intended use of U.S. FDA approved stent(s) in the FP distribution as the definitive treatment option.\n2. Non-stent intervention: Allow all clinically indicated adjunctive device interventions during the study procedure with an intended use of U.S. FDA approved non-stent based treatments in the FP distribution as the definitive treatment option and use of stents for bail-out indications.	Enrollment-20 months\nFollow-up duration after last patient enrolled-12 months\nEnd of follow-up to data base lock-6 months\nData base lock to completion of analysis-6 months\nTotal study duration from enrollment to completion of analysis-42 months.	Enrolled participants will be followed till a TLR qualifying event. TLR-free patients will be followed for a maximum duration of 12 months from the study procedure. As a real world registry, XLPAD is informed consent deferred by UT Southwestern Medical Center institutional review board (IRB). To be as close to clinical care as possible, enrolled patients in the trial will have a 30 days post-procedure visit, a 6 month phone visit and 12 month end-of study face to face visit for TLR-free participants. This is similar to routine clinical follow-up. All laboratory, pre-and post-procedure care will be conducted as per the participating site standards. Procedural techniques, medication and discharge recommendations will be according to the discretion of the operator and site PI per established clinical standards.

Following the CONSORT guideline the non-inferiority component of this study will be conducted using intent to treat analysis, including all participants as randomized regardless of their actual treatment. The non-inferiority analysis will also performed on per-protocol sample within this initial analytical set, which will include only randomized patients who receive the assigned treatment. We will use sequential non-inferiority and superiority analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint, with the type I error controlled by Bonferroni procedure. Specifically, the non-inferiority test, such as Farrington-Manning method, will be used to estimate the upper limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between the two treatment groups (non-stent minus stent) in CD-TLR rate at 12 months, with the width of this interval signifying the extent of non-inferiority. If this upper limit of the one-sided 97.5% CI does not exceed the non-inferiority margin of 10% from the CD-TLR rate in the stent-based group, then non-stent treatment would be considered non-inferior to stent-based in terms of efficacy. If this condition is satisfied, then a one-sided significance level of 2.5% will be used for superiority testing. The Kaplan-Meier survival analyses will be used to study the time to CD-TLR occurrence during the 12-month follow-up, and the log-rank test will be used to test for differences between two treatment groups.\nCategorical variables will be reported as counts and percentages and compared with Fisher's exact test or Chi-square test as appropriate. Continuous variables will be reported as median values and quartiles or as mean and standard deviation, as appropriate, and compared using the Student t test or nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test accordingly. All tests will be performed at a two-sided significance level of 5% otherwise specified. Statistical analyses will be performed with SAS, version 9.2 or higher.	Each site will be expected to enroll ~2 participants per month for a period of 20 months. The study plans to enlist 20 participating U.S. sites. These assumptions are based on enrollment data available in the ongoing XLPAD registry that currently has approximately 3600 participants enrolled since 2007 at the rate of approximately 3.4 participants per site per month. The XLPAD coordinating center is located at UT Southwestern Medical Center and has considerable experience with site screening, contracting and IRB procedures, site personnel training and ultimately activating the site and monitoring their progress and data quality. XLPAD is a core laboratory adjudicated real-world registry and the angiographic core laboratory is located VA North Texas Health Care System, Dallas, TX (VANTHCS) providing complete, secure and independent adjudication. All participating sites provide deidentified procedure angiographic data via CD or DVD to the core laboratory through an established pathway using mail codes and pre-paid FedEx mailing slips. All participants provide HIPPAA authorization for such data transfer and for requesting outside hospital records if necessary.

We hypothesize that variation in treatment is a major, yet unrecognized, contributor to the large variation in post-concussion outcome. Although this observational study does not meet the NIH Definition of a Clinical Trial, it accomplishes two crucial pre-clinical trial tasks: 1) It determines which existing concussion treatments appear effective and thus appropriate for study in a future formal clinical trial and 2) It establishes a robust infrastructure for conducting large-scale concussion clinical trials.	We propose a prospective, observational study of treatments administered to concussion patients treated at clinics within the Concussion Clinical Trial Network. This network has yet to be established, and could possibly include concussion clinics affiliated with universities hosting a CTSI.  Subjects will be identified at their initial visit with the provider in participating concussion clinics. Participating clinics will collect assessment and outcome information in a systematic fashion (see proposal for details). However, treatments will be left entirely to the discretion of the individual providers at each clinic. Assessment information will be obtained in the clinic with the patient present, while long-term outcomes (6, 12 and 24 weeks post-injury) will be determined by telephone interview (see proposal for details).	The primary objective of this study is to determine the comparative effectiveness of the most commonly recommended concussion treatments on long-term outcomes, after control for appropriate covariates. This will generate hypotheses and form the basis for future randomized trials to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. Secondary objectives include a) establishing a network of outpatient concussion clinics to collect observational data on patients >13 years of age, b)describing the range of treatments administered to concussed patients in the network and c) determining long-term outcome among concussion patients treated within the network.	Outcome will be determined by telephone interview at 6, 12, and 24 weeks after injury. The primary outcome will be incomplete symptomatic recovery (>1 post concussive symptoms) at 12 weeks post-injury. This will be determined by the following tools recommended in the NINDS Common Data Elements for TBI: Health and Behavior Inventory (13-16 years of age) and the Rivermead Post Concussion Questionnaire  (>16 years of age).\nSecondary outcomes will be incomplete functional recovery at 12 weeks (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended [GOS-E] score <7), and time to resolution of all post-concussion symptoms.	1	Inclusion criteria: \nPatient is evaluated at an outpatient concussion clinic within the network. \nConcussion diagnosis is confirmed by provider on initial evaluation. \nSubject is able to provide appropriate consent / assent.\nExclusion criteria: \nSubject is not thought to have suffered a concussion after the initial evaluation.     \nSubject is unable to provide consent/assent. \nSubject is <13 years of age.	We propose to use the Clinical & Translational Science Award (CTSA) Trial Innovation Network to establish a consortium of concussion clinics affiliated with universities hosting a CTSI.  The number of clinics required for the network will depend on 1) confirmation of our sample size calculation and 2) knowledge of the number of patients seen in clinics that may have interest in participating, which as yet to be determined.	Although this study is observational and without an intervention, it accomplishes two critical pre-clinical trial tasks: 1) It determines which existing concussion treatments appear effective and thus appropriate for study in a future clinical trial and 2) It establishes a robust infrastructure for conducting large-scale concussion clinical trials. Without this pre-trial preparation, any clinical trial of a putative concussion intervention is likely to be under-informed and underpowered. The next planned phase will be to conduct a prospective interventional study, informed by the findings of the current project. It is anticipated that this concussion clinic network will be in a unique position to evaluate the effectiveness of new putative concussion treatments, and make a major contribution to overall improvement in long-term post-concussive outcomes.	5 years (60 months)	6 months	\N	For the two binary outcomes of interest (12-week symptomatic recovery and 12-week functional recovery), classification trees, which are largely nonparametric and based on recursive partitioning, will be used for developing a rule for classifying and grouping subjects as having complete recovery (good outcome) vs incomplete recovery (poor outcome). These methods involve the construction of binary trees, with successive splits of the observations at nodes of the tree according to the value of the "best" available predictor. The regression tree and nodes will be clinically informed so the results have the most value and applicability to a real-world clinic setting. A binary tree for a given regression/classification problem is developed recursively by first choosing optimal cut points for each predictor, and then selecting the "best" predictor for the subset of the observations at the current node of the tree.  The observations are then split according to the cut point for the chosen variable and the process is repeated.  Each final node of the tree results in a classification of subjects as having either good or poor outcome, and misclassification probabilities are readily estimated.  A resulting classification rule, based on the selected predictors, is also produced. A strength of these methods is that a cross-validation procedure is available for pruning back the tree to avoid over-fitting.  First, a large tree is grown until the nodes reach a minimum size.  This tree is pruned back by minimizing a penalized measure of node impurity, where the penalty term is a function of a tuning parameter and the number of terminal nodes of the tree; a higher penalty is assigned to a more "complex" tree.  Cross-validation is used to determine the value of the tuning parameter. It is anticipated that the terminal nodes of the final tree will yield groups of subjects with good outcome that are defined by subject/injury characteristics and treatment applied, but also possibly by subject/injury characteristics alone that identify subjects with a high probability of good (or poor) outcome regardless of treatment.  All of these potential outcomes of this research are of interest. Although techniques such as bootstrap aggregation ("bagging") can be used to reduce instability in tree construction, interpretability of the tree is lost in the process.  Since the main goal of the analysis is focused on identifying determinants of outcome, particularly settings in which certain treatments are especially effective, and not on prediction, such model-averaging methods are less appropriate here. These analyses will be performed separately for each binary outcome. \n\nFor the outcome based on time to resolution of post-concussive symptoms, similar analytic methods based on survival trees will be used.  These methods partition the sample into different subsets that have different levels of "risk" of symptom resolution.  These methods can also be applied in the setting of time-dependent covariates40 and discrete event times.	To be developed in conjunction with TIN

Fetuses with 2° AVB detected < 12 hours after a normal heart rate/rhythm will be treated with dexamethasone and IVIG and evaluated by weekly echocardiograms for rhythm progression (to CAVB), regression (to 1° AVB or NSR), or no change.  We hypothesize that the proposed intervention will increase the proportion of successful treatment from 35%  to 75%.\nSpecific Aim 2: To assess  natural history of fetal AV nodal prolongation measured by echocardiography. Many centers believe that an AV interval of 150 ms measured by echocardiography represents 1° AVB. However, data from simultaneous echo and magnetocardiography (fMCG) suggests that the echo AV interval overestimates the electrocardiographic PR interval by 20-30 ms. Thus, participating centers have agreed to withhold treatment until a threshold of the echo AV interval reaches 170 ms We hypothesize that infants with an untreated fetal AV interval <170 ms will be born in normal sinus rhythm (NSR).\nSpecific Aim 3: Determine the incidence of third degree AV block at initial detection and summarize outcomes of extra-nodal anti-Ro mediated cardiac disease. This is a descriptive aim summarizing the outcome of fetuses with 3rd degree AV block or with extra-nodal cardiac injury.	An open label, multi-institutional prospective single arm interventional clinical trial.\nThe primary purpose is to determine if early detection (< 12 hours after a normal fetal heart rate/rhythm) and early TREATMENT (the intervention) will restore sinus rhythm (NSR) by the time of the baby's birth.  While a placebo-controlled trial would strengthen the results, despite clinical equipoise, our collaborating centers find this approach unacceptable. \nA sample size of 13 fetuses with 2° AVB ensures 80% power to detect whether expeditious treatment (INTERVENTION) increases the response rate (restoration of NSR) from 35-75%.  \nEnrollment is projected at 1000 at risk pregnancies, anticipating at least 2% of fetuses will develop disease eligible for treatment, resulting in 20 estimated cases with second degree AVB	Specific Aim 1. The primary outcome will be % of treated fetuses whose rhythm regresses from 2° to 1° or NSR at the time of birth. The secondary outcome is % of neonates who are pacemaker free at 3 months of age.\nSpecific Aim 2. The primary outcome will be the % of fetuses with an AV interval < 170 ms who are in NSR at birth. \nSpecific Aim 3: Outcome of anti-Ro mediated third degree AV block and extra-nodal cardiac injury	Primary end-points: \nSpecific Aim 1. The primary outcome will be % of treated fetuses whose rhythm regresses from 2° to 1° or NSR at the time of birth. The end-point is the rhythm on 12-lead electrocardiogram at birth. The secondary outcome is % of neonates who are pacemaker free at 3 months of age. the end-point is if the infant has been paced or not by 3 months of age.\nSpecific Aim 2. The primary outcome will be the % of fetuses with an AV interval < 170 ms who are in NSR at birth.  The end-point is the rhythm on 12-lead electrocardiogram at birth\nSpecific Aim 3: Echo and 12 lead ECG at birth	1	Inclusion criteria: Pregnant women at 16-18 weeks of gestation with: 1. documented anti-Ro antibody titers at a level associated  with fetal AV block. Mothers whose levels are less than those levels associated with fetal AVB will not be enrolled or counted in the total  but the birth rhythm of their infants will be recorded 2. Fetuses having a normal cardiac rhythm and heart rate as determined by fetal echocardiography at the time of recruitment; 3. A willingness to monitor their fetus's heart rate and rhythm 3x/day in the ambulatory setting AND undergo a weekly fetal echocardiogram form the time of enrollment to 25 weeks of gestation.  .\nExclusion criteria: 1. Non-pregnant women or women without anti-SSA antibodies; 2. Anti-SSA + women  < 16 weeks and > 18 weeks pregnant; 3. Pregnant women with only anti-SSB antibodies in the absence of anti-SSA antibodies; 4. Fetuses of anti-SSA positive women who have abnormal echocardiograms at the time of recruitment.	Currently 16 sites are involved in the feasibility of the home Doppler monitoring study, including 3 in Canada. They will continue to participate in the proposed clinical trial. In addition, with the Co-PI Dr. Jill Buyon from NYU who is the lead investigator of the neonatal lupus registry, we hope to increase the number of participating sites to 25.	The study interventions for fetal 2nd degree AV block: 1.  Treatment with daily oral dexamethasone and one dose of intravenous immune globulin within 12 hours of a normal fetal heart rate/rhythm. Intervention for an AV interval >170 ms: same as #1.	We will open the study to enrollment if we obtain funding (announcement Oct 2018)\nData analysis will be complete at the end of 5 years.\nTotal time in months is 60 (5x12).	Mothers and fetuses  will participate from 16-18 weeks until delivery  After delivery, infants will participate for less than or equal to 5 days (how long it should take to get the 12 lead ECG) IF the infant is in NSR. IF the fetus is in 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, they  and their mothers (as their guardians) will participate until 3 months of age.	No one has any disclosures.	Aim 1: For the primary outcome a one-sided test of proportions will test the % regressing, p1, with a null hypothesis (H0) of p1<0.376 (estimate from a meta-analysis of previous studies) and an alternative hypothesis (H1) of p1>0.75. For the primary outcome, a sample size of 13 fetuses with 2' AVB ensures 80% power with alpha=2.5% to detect whether expeditious treatment increases the proportion from the historic control of 37.6% to 75% (i.e., 9 out of 13 fetuses regressing). For the secondary outcome a one-sided test of proportions will test the % of neonates who are pacemaker free at 3 months of age, p2, with a null hypothesis (H0) of p2>0.204 (estimate from a meta-analysis of previous studies). While the aim is not powered for the secondary outcome, there is approximately 80% power with alpha=2.5% to detect an alternative hypothesis (H1) of p2<0.080 (i.e., 0 or 1 fetus out of 13 needing a pacemaker).\n\nAim 2: Given the heterogeneity in current treatment practices and the lack of previous data to use in proposing a formal statistical hypothesis, this aim is exploratory and no power calculations are provided. To summarize the % of fetuses with an AV interval < 170 ms who are NSR at birth we will present the proportion of cases with a 95% confidence interval around the estimate from our study. Additionally, we will descriptively categorize the trajectory of all fetuses within this aim to describe the natural history of prolongation and summarize the proportion of cases which advance to 1' AVB, 2' AVB, or 3' AVB throughout the course of monitoring and up until birth.\n\nAim 3: Given that CAVB has never been observed to permanently regress, this aim is descriptive and no power calculations are provided. The proportion of cases identified as CAVB during monitoring and their trajectory will be provided, and if any cases are shown to permanently regress we will describe the trajectory with a detailed case study and history. Further, in this descriptive aim, the occurrence of any other anti-Ro disease which causes extra-nodal injury beyond the AV node will be summarized with counts and percentages of the overall study sample.	16 sites are currently actively recruiting anti-Ro + mothers to undergo home Doppler and fetal echo surveillance. Thus far, 250 mothers have been enrolled (about 96% of those recruited) and 95% have completed the monitoring protocol We have had 5 mothers develop AV block during this time. Those sites will participate in the new study if it is funded: additional sites have been contacted regarding the current proposal and have agreed to participate based on funding. \nI think it will take 4.5 years to enroll the planned number of subjects based on our previous enrollments and the addition of at least 9 new sites based on Dr. Buyon's reputation as the lead investigator for the neonatal lupus registry. \nRecruitment efforts are VERY important!\nWe have a website called heartsoundsathome .com, but no national strategy for recruitment.
29	2016-12-06	50	\N	\N	Phase III trial of Ezh2 inhibitor to augment or replace checkpoint blockade	Ezh2 Study	\N	Objectives:    1. To confirm effective Ezh2 inhibitor doses (optimal biologic dose) that suppress H3K27me3 in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)    2. To perform comparative study of Ezh2 inhibitor        a. to synergize with checkpoint blockade to induce tumor responses (nivolumab vs nivolumab + Ezh2 inhibitor        b. to replace checkpoint blockade to induce tumor responses (nivolumab vs Ezh2 inhibitor)    We hypothesize that:     1. Ezh2 inhibition will restore IL2 production in situ in tumors and suppress T cell exhaustion.     2. Restored IL2 will act synergistically with checkpoint blockade for a more complete reversal of TIL exhaustion.    3. Reversal of exhaustion will restore the full potency of TILs to eradicate tumors at higher efficiency than with checkpoint blockade alone.     We will be requesting Level 2 Comprehensive Consultation Services	The primary aim is to conduct the described Phase III RCT.  A lead-in Phase Ib/Pilot will be conducted to ensure that the dose of Ezh2 inhibitor is sufficient to reverse the H3K27 trimethylation that suppresses the IL2 promoter.  The effectiveness of the drug was previously measured in Phase I trials of E7348 Ezh2 inhibitor (Epizyme) in cancer trials that showed maximum benefit to suppress H3K27me3 in skin biopsies was achieved with 400 mg/day, whereas doses of 1600 mg/day were tested without toxicity. This is the drug and testing range we will employ.  We need to establish that the same range of drug dose is effective in T cells inside tumors.  Once this effectivenss is confirmed, we will use this dose with a standard regimen of nivolumab in the Phase III trial.    Pilot/Phase Ib trial (year 1)    Treatment plan: Treat 3 pts on 3 dose levels (N=9) of E7438, 400 mg, 800 mg and 1600 mg orally, divided wice daily, for 1 month.  Eligibility: Patients with PDL1+ metastatic melanoma accessible for biopsy, with TILs exhausted by PD1+ staining and overexpressing Ezh2 (virtually all).  Objective: To establish effective dose of E7348.  Monitoring: PD: Tumor biopsy at baseline, 1 wk and 1 mo, TILs assessed for H3K27 gross methylation and for intracellular IL2 by in situ staining.  A few larger biopsies for TIL isolation and testing IL2 promoter by ChIP/qPCR.  PK: Blood levels E7438 by mass spec.     Expected results: We expect that all E7438 doses will equally penetrate tumor and suppress H3K27me3 in TILs, with increased IL2 in the T cells.  We may incidentally note tumor shrinkage in response to the treatment.     Pitfalls: If IL2 promoter trimethylation in TILs is not reversed, then we will confer with the FDA to further escalate the E7438 dose levels, which at maximum (1600 mg/d) are still 50-fold below the highest in mice without toxicity.     Phase III trial (year 2-4)    The Pilot study will confirm a dose for an ensuing randomized Phase II or III test of E7438 plus nivolumab versus nivolumab alone and versus E7438 alone that tests our hypotheses of a benefit from Ezh2 inhibition.  A more complete reversal of exhaustion under the combination could result in an entirely new treatment paradigm for cancers.    Treatment plan: Treat 400 pts randomized onto 3 arms of nivolumab at standard dose, E7438 or their combination, for 2 months.  Eligibility: Patients with metastatic cancers eligible for nivolumab single-agent therapy in three patient groups (PD1+ melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and Hodgkin's lymphoma).  Objective: To establish effective dose of E7348.  Monitoring: Safety and tumor response.  (The actual number of patients will be determined by the biostatistical analysis under the Consultation services.)    Expected results: We expect that all Ezh2 inhibitor + nivolumab will show synergy with benefit over either agent alone, with markedly improved tumor responses and increase in cures.     Pitfalls: If excess autoimmune toxicity is seen with the combination of agents, then we will hold doses of E7438 and reinstitute with reduced doses when toxicity subsides, determined on a patient-by-patient basis.	The overall objective is to show more complete reversal of exhaustion under the combination of Ezh2 inhibitor and nivolumab versus nivolumab alone. This could result in greatly increased response rates and an entirely new treatment paradigm for metastatic cancers.      Specific aims:    1. To perform a Pilot/Phase Ib to confirm effective Ezh2 inhibitor doses (optimal biologic dose) that suppress H3K27me3 in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)  a. To biopsy patient tumors before and after treatment to assess status of H3K27me3 in TILs    b. To correlate reduced H3K27me3 status with Ezh2 dose    2. To perform a randomized Phase III study of nivolumab versus Ezh2 inhibitor versus the combination    a. to assess safety of Ezh2 in combination with nivolumab    b. to assess effectiveness of Ezh2 to synergize with checkpoint blockade to induce tumor responses (nivo vs nivo + Ezh2 inhib)    c. to assess whether combination therapy is superior Ezh2 inhibitor alone (nivo + Ezh2 inhib vs Ezh2 inhib)	Pilot/Phase Ib:    suppression of H3K27 trimethylation in TILs    Phase III    tumor response, survival and safety.	\N	Inclusion:    1.

Significant disease	Not provided	For the Pilot/Phase Ib, the interventions are oral administration of Ezh2 inhibitor x 1 month and biopsies pre and post treatment.    For the Phase III, the interventions are administration of Ezh2 inhibitor (oral), nivolumab (iv) or both.     Other aspects are standard oncology management.

We will seek assistance under a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and support in identifying study sites.	There are three cancers envisioned for this study: metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and Hodgkin's lymphoma.    For the Phase Ib, all tests will be performed at TMC, with N=9 subjects. This is achieved with patient resources at TMC.  For the Phase III, we will seek to establish 10 centers to accelerate enrollent, with N=400 subjects (number to be determined by the biostatisticians).

Our chief aim is to compare short-term (3 months post-baseline, which is 1 month post-intervention) and long-term (9 months post-baseline, which is 7 months post-intervention) outcomes after the HeartHealth intervention versus usual care on the primary endpoint of the single CVD risk factor reduction goal (i.e., blood pressure, one element of lipid profile, body mass index, or physical activity level) chosen by the participant in the first week of usual care or intervention (goal setting is an intervention component). We hypothesize that the 2-month HeartHealth intervention, by actively promoting self-care of co-morbid CVD risk factors, will be superior to usual care in promoting achievement of patients' CVD risk reduction goals.\nSpecific Aim 2. Compare short-term and long-term outcomes on the secondary endpoints of each of the following CVD risk reduction goals: blood pressure, lipid profile, body mass index, and physical activity level for intervention versus usual care groups.\nWe hypothesize that CVD risk factors will be better in HeartHealth intervention group versus usual care.\nSpecific aim 3. Compare the impact of HeartHealth to usual care on secondary endpoints of hsCRP, a biomarker of CVD risk, on adherence to recommended CVD risk reduction measures assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale, a behavioral marker, and on a psychological factor, depressive symptoms, which interfere with adherence to life-style modification.

We propose to conduct the 1st U.S. safety CT of MSC in sJIA and to develop biomarkers to detect MSCs effects early treatment.\n\nBackground and Significance:\nsJIA is the sub-type of JIA that is associated with the most morbidity and mortality in children <16 years of age. It is best understood as an immune-mediated disease with features of derangement in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. In the past decade, IL-1 and IL-6 pathway inhibitors have markedly improved the lives of children with JIA, but none is curative. Both IL-1 and Il-6 inhibitors may partially replace steroids, previously a mainstay in sJIA treatment.  None completely prevent the potentially fatal complication called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Despite effective therapies, approximately 10% of sJIA children either are refractory or cannot tolerate bDMARDs. Cellular therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represents a novel immunomodulatory approach that is being used in other settings, including graft vs host disease (GVHD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therapeutic use of these cells has been safe in GVHD, IBD and RA (in clinical trials (CT)). Infusion of MSCs does not require pre-conditioning as MSCs express low level of MHC molecules andCD80/CD86 co-stimulatory molecules. Notably, some sJIA parents have arranged MSC infusion for their sJIA child through medical tourism; thus a clinical trial of MSCs in sJIA would meet an unmet need and will be safe.  We propose to conduct the 1st U.S. safety CT of MSC in sJIA and to develop biomarkers to detect MSCs effects early treatment.	To conduct focus groups with parents, patients (if age appropriate) and physicians informing design of a phase I CT including the following issues (1) use of autologous or allogeneic cells in the CT, (2) whether we should use bone marrow derived MSCs (bmMSCs) or adipose derived MSCs (aMSCs) and (3) inclusion/exclusion criterion. \n\nDrs. Singer and her team has developed the materials for the focus groups that have already begun and the PCORI funded PARTNERS (https://carragroup.org/resources/partners) has recently approved our application to help populate focus groups and to review inclusion and exclusion criterion. We are amending our IRB to allow them to see aggregate focus group data. Then the approval will also be approved at DUKE, the IRB of record for the PARTNERS group.\n\nii) To conduct pilot studies using MSC and their products to culture sJIA PBMC to determine which changes a) in DNA methylation (Breitman); b) immune cell subsets (Mellins); c) suppression of CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ Tcells, or monocytes will be developed as potential biomarkers for a Phase I CT in sJIA (Singer/Breitman). iii) To design and perform an IND-requiring Phase I CT of MSCs in sJIA refractory to cDMARDs and bDMARDs. The pre-selected sites for the clinical trial are the MetroHealth System (MHMC)(CWRU CTSA site), Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital (RB&C)(CWRU CTSA), Lucille Packard Children's Hospital (Stanford CTSA), Seattle Children's Hospital (UW CTSA), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) (UC CTSA) and Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital in Hackensack,NJ.	To design perform an IND phase I study of twelve children (at six trial sites) who have had incomplete responses to conventional and biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in order to demonstrate the safety of cell-based therapy in sJIA. \n\nTo induce immune tolerance and host reparative mechanisms using MSCs. \n\nTo test innovative biomarkers that indicate the subjects have had a biological response to MSCs. To further our understanding of immune mechanisms that contribute to refractory sJIA and to demonstrate which of these mechanisms are responsive to cell-based therapy.	1) Safety; 2) biomarkers (to be determined); 3) exploratory endpoints.	2	sJIA diagnoses with either active systemic features and/or polyarticular arthritis.\nFailed at least 1 conventional DMARD and either anti-IL1 and/or IL-6/IL6R inhibition or failed both IL-1 and IL6/IL6R inhibition.	The pre-selected sites for the clinical trial are the MetroHealth System (MHMC)(CWRU CTSA site), Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital (RB&C)(CWRU CTSA), Lucille Packard Children's Hospital (Stanford CTSA), Seattle Children's Hospital (UW CTSA), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) (UC CTSA) and Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital in Hackensack,NJ.	Mesenchymal stem cells. Following focus groups we will determine the tissue source of MSCs (bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose). Whether we do a single or two infusions (1 placebo, 1 MSC) has not yet been decided. Based on our experience obtaining an IND for our NIH-supported Phase 1 study of MSCs in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis we anticipate that the FDA may ask us to include an opportunity for measurements of biomarkers from "placebo subjects". The study design may include up to 2 infusions: one group will receive placebo first and one group will receive placebo last, depending on the feedback of the focus groups and the FDA following at the pre-IND and IND stage..	30 months	Up to 14 months (the FDA requires a one year follow up from the time of cell infusion)	None.	This will depend on the study design. The use of Bayesian statistics will be considered. Due to the small sample size and that this is primarily a safety study, some of the statistics will likely be descriptive.	The clinical trial is to begin at MetroHealth in September of 2018 with most of the sites coming aboard January of 2019. The enrollment is to be done over 16 months. \n\nWe estimate this schedule based on meetings with parent of sJIA children and based on interactions at the sJIA Foundation meeting.

We hypothesize that treatment of HD patients with atypical antipsychotics will improve neuropsychiatric symptoms (primary outcome), and chorea (secondary outcome).	The primary purpose of this phase 3 study is to establish the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD. This will be a multi-center study with participants who are members of the Huntington's Study Group. This randomized, double-blind, crossover trial will have two arms: patients taking and not taking VMAT2 inhibitors for chorea control. Participants in each arm will be randomized to start with one of two 8-week treatment protocols (treating physician antipsychotic choice or placebo) and will cross over after its completion and appropriate washout period. Physician choice will include an antipsychotic from a limited list of currently used generic medications (risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine). Physician will determine which of these three medications is most appropriate for the patient by considering patient comorbidities and known medication side-effects.	The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics for controlling neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD. \nH1: Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine) will reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD patients regardless of patient exposure to VMAT2 inhibitors. \n\nThe secondary objective of this study is an exploratory analysis of antipsychotic effect on chorea scores in HD patients. \nH2: Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine) will reduce Total Maximal chorea shore in HD patients regardless of patient exposure to VMAT2 inhibitors.	The primary endpoint, neuropsychiatric symptoms, will be measured using the total score from the Problem Behaviors Assessment short form (PBA-s).\nThe secondary endpoint, chorea, will be measured using the Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) subscore from the United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score (UHDRS TMS). \nAdditional secondary endpoints include the UHDRS TMS and quantitative motor (Q Motor) assessment.	1	Inclusion Criteria:\n1)\tDiagnosis of motor-manifest HD through clinical assessment by a movement disorders specialist or by genetic testing \n2)\tPresence of at least 1 neuropsychiatric symptom that requires treatment\n3)\tThe decision to use antipsychotics is based primarily on the need to treat the neuropsychiatric symptom, though chorea should also be present\n4)\t>18 years of age\n5)\tAbility to understand and speak English \n6)\tTMC score of 5 or higher at screening\n\t\n\nExclusion Criteria: \n1)\tPatients without chorea or with a TMC score less than 5\n2)\tIn the physician's opinion, the patient would be at risk for harm to self or others while on placebo\n3)\tUse of an antipsychotic in the 30 days prior to screening\n4)\tCurrent suicidal ideation or past suicide attempt	We plan to include 10 sites from the Huntington Study Group network in the United States	Each medication and placebo will be prepared in tablet form and taken orally. Site investigators will determine which of the three antipsychotics to give the patient based on individual patient characteristics. Participants will be titrated over 4 weeks, assuming tolerance of medication, to a total dose of aripiprazole 15 mg daily, risperidone 2 mg twice daily, or olanzapine 15 mg at night. During titration, the physician may choose to reduce the dose to the previous dose in the event that a higher dose results in an adverse event attributable to that medication.	Total duration: 3 years \nStart-up: Months 1-8\nRecruitment: Months 9-19 (1 patient per site, per month)\nData collection ends: Month 24\nData analysis: Months 24-36	20 weeks plus an optional 10-week extension for real-world efficacy assessment.

We will utilize PECARN Registry data and identify barriers informed by the interdisciplinary conceptual framework of clinicians' compliance with evidence-based guidelines.	This is a mixed methods study evaluating the treatment of children with SCD presenting with acute painful VOC. The approach to Aims 1a and 1b is an observational study of all pain related SCD visits to seven EDs submitting data to the PECARN Registry. There are approximately 2,000 children with SCD who are part of the PECARN Registry in any given year. Of these patients, there are approximately 2,600 visits to the ED per year by 1,200 children for acute painful VOC. With this Registry project, we will be poised to better understand the current practices for prevention and management of VOC for SCD children presenting to the ED. The approach to Aims 2a and 2b is a mixed methods study of the barriers and facilitators to adherence to guideline based care. We will utilize quantitative data on usual care from each of the clinical sites to identify factors associated with guideline adherence. We will use the Barrier Identification and Mitigation tool to gather qualitative data to guide us in identifying barriers and facilitators and implementation strategies that will be used to plan for a future hybrid trial. This tool has been used by Provonost, Gurses and collaborators to improve quality of care by identifying and removing or mitigating barriers to guideline compliance. Ultimately our work has the potential to improve the care of children seeking ED/hospital care for acute painful complications of SCD that ultimately will result in implementation of the recommended national care guidelines	Aim 1a: To assess the adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute painful VOC, as measured by the time to first opioid and time between opioid doses in children with SCD presenting to the emergency department.\nAim 1b: To assess the adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the use of hydroxyurea in children hospitalized after presenting to the ED with acute painful VOC, as measured by home medication list at arrival and discharge.  \n\n\nAim 2a: Informed by the interdisciplinary conceptual framework of clinicians' compliance with evidence-based guidelines, identify the barriers and facilitators that influence the rapid adoption of sickle cell disease guidelines.\nAim 2b: To develop implementation strategies to increase timeliness of care for acute VOC pain crises in the ED and increase the proportion of eligible patients receiving hydroxyurea at the time of hospital discharge.	Primary outcomes of interest: Time in minutes from ED triage to 1st dose of opioid administered; Time in minutes between first and second dose, second and third dose, etc. and the frequency count of total number of opioid doses given in the ED; Hydroxyurea as active medication on the home medication list at time of admission to the ED and at time of discharge from the hospital \n\nSecondary outcomes of interest: \nSpecific opioid/opioids that are given for each patient\nSpecific route of administration to include intravenous, intranasal, and/or oral\nTime from ED arrival to time the patient leaves the ED as measured by the noted arrival time in the ED and the time documented in the EHR that the patient leaves the ED\nTime from ED arrival to disposition as measured by the noted arrival time in the ED and the time the order is placed to discharge the patient to home or to hospitalize the patient \nProportion of patients presenting to the ED with an acute painful VOC who are hospitalized	2	To be eligible a child with sickle cell disease need to have made a qualifying visit recorded in the Registry from one of the participating sites (Aim 1) or during the study period and interviewed (Aim 2).	For all aspects of this study, all seven sites currently in the Registry project will be included: Lurie Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati), Nationwide Children's Hospital,\nChildren's Hospital of Colorado,Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,Children's National Medical Center. The University of Utah Data Coordinating Center is also involved.	The intervention is the analyses of the processes for the dosing of opioids and the use of hydroxyurea. There are no interventional study interventions that are drugs or biologics, rather the study seeks to understand the current state of care for patients with sickle cell disease presenting with acute pain.	24 months	No specific study related visits for patients as part of the study Aim 1. That is all data collection as part of the PECARN Registry project. For Aim 2. Interviews will occur with families and providers; they will be single interviews. There are no repeat visits as part of this study.	No financial ties or other conflicts of interest are present.	Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze variables outlined in Aims 1a and 1b. As noted above, we will identify high and low performer sites and those that fit in between. For Aim 1a, the mean time to opioid for encounters in a particular calendar month will be provided as a graphical representation. For Aim 1b, we will determine the proportion of hospital encounters in which eligible patients had hydroxyurea as an active medication at admission to the ED and at discharge from a hospitalization. We will examine the trends in the data over the time frame and account for any contextual changes that may have been introduced into the care of these patients at these sites. For example, at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin site we began using IN fentanyl in the ED in the year 2017 and expect the trend data in timeliness will reflect this practice change. \nAt the completion of Aims 1a and 1b, we will have measured the baseline adherence to the NHLBI SCD-specific guidelines related to the ED care of pain and the use of hydroxyurea in patients in whom pain has resulted in hospitalization, and thus significantly affected their quality of life. We will also have established trends in data over that time and noted any interventions that have already occurred and the varied effects those interventions may have had at different sites. \n\nFor aim 2, The PIs will interview the ED and hematology co-investigators to get feedback and input on the content and presentation of the data in the performance report card to improve it for use as an implementation strategy in the future hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial. The audit and feedback (A&F) process will be informed by review of the literature and examination of current PECARN dashboards for other diseases to determine the best way to provide feedback for the future implementation trial. For example, with our access to the PECARN Registry, we are well positioned to implement A&F strategies to support changes in practitioners' behavior.  As recommended, we will ensure that we tie our strategies with theoretical justification so they can be testable. Moreover, the effectiveness of A&F has been shown to be variable probably because of the many variations of the process: one can vary the timing of delivery, the format of the feedback (verbal or written) or content (positive or negative). To diminish the variability of delivery of A&F, our plan is to use a fidelity framework to guide and evaluate the design, training of providers, delivery of the feedback, and target audience of our study.  Additionally, we will use the components of behavior change techniques (BCTs) to ensure that the intervention components, theoretical underpinnings and the key assumptions are clearly articulated.	\N
391	2018-08-24	20	\N	t	Targeted Silica Nanoparticles for Real-Time Image-Guided Intraoperative Mapping of Nodal Metastases	Targeted Silica Nanoparticles	3	This sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping clinical trial, an extension of our previous human study (IND# 110375) demonstrating safety, will assess the utility of ultrasmall (~6 nm hydrodynamic diameter) fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles (C dots) for detecting disease spread to local/regional nodes in metastatic melanoma, colorectal and breast cancer patients.	This is a SLN mapping feasibility study that will enroll melanoma, colorectal and breast patients at MSKCC. Pre-operative standard-of-care SPECT/CT imaging findings of the primary melanoma and draining lymph node basin will be used to optimize patient positioning in the operative suite prior to conducting fluorescence imaging and surgical excision of the primary lesion and SLN/s. An intraoperative, hand-held multichannel fluorescence camera system will acquire two-dimensional large field-of-view NIR images in the context of adjacent soft tissue structures for assessing the full extent of nodal disease within the nodal basin. The camera system will be optimized for real-time, detection of Cy5.5 optical signal during SLN mapping procedures in humans. Confirmation of fluorescence signal from tumor and nodes within the surgically exposed nodal basin will be based on measurements of low-energy gamma emissions from 99mTc-sulfur colloid using routine gamma probes. These probes will be used to determine counts at the tumor site, identify SLN/s and suspected metastatic nodes, as well as assay background tissues. \n\nNon-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots will be injected intradermally in 4-quadrants about the tumor site into intact skin, following by high resolution optical scanning in video mode (>15 frames per second) to map dynamic changes in particle transit from the injection site into the draining lymphatics and nodes with successive surgical exposure. The maximum total dose injected will be 12 nanomoles, which corresponds to 100 times the NOAEL determined in mice, on a nanomol/gr basis. We have previously safely administered up to 11 nanomoles of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots in about 14 patients, escalating the dose to optimize detection. Furthermore, in colorectal cancer patients, we will administer the particle prior to or after the standard of care agent ICG in order to improve overall flow to the sentinel node. Up to 5 ml injectable volumes (in 0.9% NaCl) will be used to achieve a final total dose that falls within this pre-set range of doses (i.e., 5.6 - 24 nanomoles.) Intradermal injections into the extremity will utilize dose ranges similar to melanoma and breast cancer (i.e., 5.6 - 12 nanomoles) and up to 1 ml injectable volumes.	Phase 1- Breast and Colorectal Malignancies\nThe objective of this first in human SLN mapping study is to assess the feasibility of utilizing optical imaging technologies− FDA, IND-approved non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots coupled with a state-of-the-art, portable fluorescent camera system- for SLN detection in the intraoperative setting. Detected optical signal will be confirmed with measured radioactive emissions in breast patients using standard of care approaches. Feasibility will be investigated in the primary aim and first secondary aim.\n\nPrimary Aim: Assess whether locally injected non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots injected about the primary tumor site or within the  mucosa (for colorectal cases) or, can identify fluorescent  nodes within the nodal basin of colorectal malignancies and breast cancer patients intraoperatively, as determined by pathological examination. \n\nGiven the exploratory nature of this trial, the following secondary aims are proposed to address several study unknowns that relate to minimum particle dosing and the achievement of adequate optical signal in SLNs. \n\nSecondary Aim 1: Determine whether a NIR fluorescence signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of 1.1 or greater optimizes image contrast and enables identification of diseased nodes, along with the smallest dose of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots needed to achieve this threshold ratio. \n\nSecondary Aim 2: Correlate optical imaging findings of in situ and excised nodal specimens, in terms of intensity, with routine gamma counting. \n\nPhase 2-Melanoma\n The objective of this Phase 2 SLN mapping study is to assess the ongoing safety and efficacy and efficacy of  detecting nodal metastases utilizing a combination of intraoperative FDA, IND-approved non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots, fluorescent camera system.. Detected optical signal will continue to be confirmed by measured radioactive emissions from standard-of-care 99mTc sulfur colloid in melanoma patients.  Efficacy and safety endpoints will be investigated in the primary aims and first secondary aim. We will continue to monitor for any adverse events following injection of the non-radioactive particle probe. Following locally-injected, non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots about the primary tumor site and using a handheld NIR fluorescence camera system, fluorescent SLN/s within the nodal basin will be identified and assessed for metastases, with pathological correlation, as follows:\n\nPrimary Aims: \n1.\tAssess concordance of optical signal with gamma counts in excised lymph nodes after administration of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dot and Tc-99m sulfur colloid, respectively, on the basis of histologic confirmation. \n2.\tDetermine the proportion of lymph nodes identified by 99mTc sulfur colloid that are positive by cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dot visualization\n3.\tMonitor for adverse reactions to the non-radioactive particle probe as a safety endpoint.\n\n\nSecondary Aims: \n1.\tCompare detection rates of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots and Tc99m sulfur collide for pathology-positive SLNs.\n2.\tAssess 3 integrin expression levels in primary and nodal tissue specimens derived from a subset of patients	Phase 1- Breast and Colorectal Malignancies\nA total of 25  patients will be investigated comprising 2 different regions of the body (breast, and colorectal malignancies). Each cohort will be analyzed separately to assess the feasibility of conducting pre-operative SLN mapping using real-time optical detection procedures and intradermal single- or double-dose injection/s of non-radioactive cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots about the primary tumor site. Feasibility will be determined on the basis of achieving adequate image contrast for detection, as defined by signal-to-background ratios, and whether optical signal distinguishes diseased SLNs from non-diseased ones (see Appendix 4). Our sample size is chosen based on ethical, logistical and financial limitations rather than statistical considerations and is consistent with other pilot studies in the literature. Expected length of accrual is about 1 year.\n\nAll Phase I aims will be addressed with descriptive analysis. For the primary aim optical signal will be summarized as a continuous variable separately within the diseased and non-diseased lymph nodes.  No statistical analysis is planned for secondary aim 1. Secondary aim 2 of correlating optical imaging findings of SLN/s, either within the nodal basin or as excised nodal specimens, with routine gamma counting will be addressed by empirical (Pearson) and rank correlation (Spearman) methods with both variables as continuous. \n\nPhase 2-Melanoma\nThis study has two parts: in the first part 20 patients will be enrolled and imaged at a fixed optimized dose (5 nanomoles) and volume (up to 1 ml) of fluorescent cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots will be locally administered about the primary tumor site, while varying the timing interval between the injection and visualization of fluorescence signal in optically-active nodes, in order to maximize detection of metastases. Fixed optimized dose, volume, and timing interval from these studies will then be applied to another 40 enrolled patients as part of this Phase 2 trial to assess efficacy.\n\nIn the second part we will use the excised lymph nodes from 40 patients to assess concordance of optical signal with gamma counts with histological confirmation. We will estimate the ROC curve for the optical signal and report estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive and predictive values at the cutpoint corresponding to the Youden index. We will conservatively estimate that we will have 40 excised lymph nodes and we will consider the study a success if 80% (32) of the 40 lymph nodes have concordance between optical signal and pathology. This decision rule has 4% probability of declaring the study successful if the true concordance is 70%.This probability increases to 95% if the true concordance rate os 90%. \n\nProportion of lymph nodes identified by 99mTc sulfur colloid that are positive by cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dot visualization will be computed as a binomial parameter along with 95% exact confidence intervals. All adverse events will be monitored and reported. \n\nAs a secondary aim, detection rates of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots and Tc99m sulfur colloid for pathology-positive SLNs will be estimated again using a binomial proportion and an exact confidence interval. We will assess integrin expression levels in primary and nodal tissue specimens derived from a subset of patients.	1	•\t18 years of age or older\n•\tHistologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer , at MSKCC\n•\tHave one of the following disease histories:\no\tNewly-diagnosed or recurrent (local, regional, metastatic) malignant melanoma or breast cancer patients in whom SLN mapping is indicated\n\tResidual clinically or radiographically evident tumor, including primary cutaneous and mucosal melanomas\n\tPrior radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery in patients requiring flap reconstruction in the head and neck region.\n\tNewly diagnosed patients with previous excisional biopsy.\nOR\n\tNewly-diagnosed colorectal cancer patients in whom SLN mapping and total mesorectal excision with lateral pelvic sidewall dissection is indicated \n•\tAt the discretion of the physician or surgeon ,normal baseline cardiac function based upon pre-operative evaluation\n•\tAt the discretion of the physician or surgeon, ANC>1000/mcl and platelets>100,000/mcl.\n•\tAt the discretion of the physician or surgeon, bilirubin level of < 2.0 mg/dl in the absence of a history of Gilbert's disease (or pattern consistent with Gilbert's).\n•\tFor melanoma patients, f patients have a history of malignancy other than melanoma and other skin cancers in the past five years, their inclusion is up to the discretion of the physician.\n•\tAll patients of childbearing and child-creating age must be using an acceptable form of birth control \n•\tWomen who are pre-menopausal must have a negative serum pregnancy test \nSubject Exclusion Criteria\n•\tKnown pregnancy or breast-feeding.\n•\tMedical illness unrelated to the tumor which in the opinion of the attending physician and principal investigator will preclude administration of the agent.

466	2019-02-13	20	\N	f	Executive attention impairment following TBI	Attention after TBI	6	Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a fundamen-tal gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impairments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classification of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions.  The over-all objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, stria-tum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hy-pothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two stud-ies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underlying model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that charac-terizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an individ-ual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological underpin-nings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because they pro-pose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The proposed research is signifi-cant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prog-nostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI.

53	2016-12-05	70	\N	\N	Molecular Autopsy for Sudden Unexpected Death	SUD Study	\N	The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the utility of post-mortem genetic testing (molecular autopsy) for the resolution of the cause of death in sudden unexpected death (SXD) cases, and to provide risk information to living relatives of the deceased. We define SXD as any death before the age of 45 potentially due to a genetic factor. This definition includes any causes of death identified during clinical autopsy, as long as the condition was unknown before death. For example, cardiomyopathy or other potentially genetic health conditions in the deceased would still be considered SXD cases where genetic information will be useful to living relatives. The secondary objective of this study is the identification and classification of novel pathogenic genetic variants, and to identify novel causes of sudden death.	Subjects suffering sudden unexplained death will be identified by the Office of the Medical Examiner of and collaborators (CTSA sites) and be further screened according to this study's inclusion and exclusion criteria.   In addition to seeking consent for a standard, gross autopsy for the subject from the next-of-kin, a molecular autopsy will also be discussed.  In those cases where a molecular autopsy is granted, a blood sample from the deceased, and potentially a small cardiac biopsy, will be acquired for genetic testing. Biologically related family members would also be asked to provide a sample (saliva or buccal swab) for genetic testing.  For family members the rank order of preference is as follows: 1) parents, 2) siblings, and 3) offspring.  Although a biologic specimen from living, biologically related family members may be acquired; those samples will only be used for genetic testing as control and confirmatory analysis and testing dictates. Parents will be sequenced in the case of a trio, though results will only be returned as pertinent to the deceased.        A complete autopsy report must be provided at a minimum. In order to refine the subject's phenotype as concisely as possible pertinent data obtained in the immediate pre-mortem period, such as ECGs should be obtained if possible.      The samples from the deceased and some living family members will be processed and exome sequenced at STSI in most cases.  The initial analysis efforts will be focused on known genes that have been shown to be causal for sudden unexpected cardiac death (ion channels, cardiac structural proteins, etc). Further analysis leveraging family information (i.e. parents) will be utilized to identify de-novo variants that may be causal for sudden death - especially in infant cases. CTSA sites with the desire and capability to perform their own sequencing and analysis may do so and contribute to the genetic database described below.      A report of genetic findings will be generated and returned to the medical examiner. With proper consent from next-of-kin, any insights into potential causal gene variants will be communicated to the index subject's biological relatives who have consented to receive information.  This will be done via  study staff having experience in returning genetic results to a physician selected by the living family members.      All sequence and phenotype data will be organized and stored on shared computational resource which allows for statistical association of genetic variants with sudden death, as well as browsing by external users by phenotype and/or genotype data in order to identify the number of individuals with/without particular genetic variants and/or particular phenotypes. No individual level data will be accessible through this portal. This database will allow for the continuous analysis and identification of novel causes of sudden death as well as aid in the interpretation of this and other genetic studies.	The primary endpoint for this study is the discovery of genomic information that may help identify a potential cause of death in the index case and inform living, biologically related family members of their potential risk and need for further genomic analysis.    The secondary endpoint for this study is the feasibility assessment for expansion of this molecular autopsy program outside of San Diego County both nationwide and internationally.	The primary endpoint for this study is the discovery of genomic information that may help identify a potential cause of death in the index case and inform living, biologically related family members of their potential risk and need for further genomic analysis.	\N	Inclusion Criteria:    �           Index case age between 0 - 45 years    �           Clinical presentation of sudden / unexplained death    �           Living, biologically-related family members 18 years of age or older         Exclusion Criteria:    �           Premature death secondary to murder, suicide or external causal event    �           History of illicit drug use    �           History of heavy alcohol abuse    �           History of morbid obesity    �           History of known chronic comorbid medical condition thought to explain death    �           Previously diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)    �           Prior myocardial infarction (regardless of stenting or bypass)    �           Prior cerebrovascular accident (stroke or TIA)    �           History of open heart surgery (for any reason)    �           History of severe, untreated hypertensive heart disease	Not provided	Exome sequencing.	\N	\N	None.	Sequencing and identification of pathogenic variants utilizes the workflow described in Bloss CS et al. A genome sequencing program for novel undiagnosed diseases. Genet Med. 2015 Dec;17(12):995-1001.	At STSI, potential cases are identified by the San Diego Medical Examiner and reviewed for suitability by the STSI team. Suitable cases are consented for enrollment via the LifeShare organization or the STSI coordinator team. Samples are shipped to STSI for sequencing. All sequencing, analysis, and return of results is performed by STSI. The purpose of this Trial Innovation Network proposal is to determine how best to expand this program across the country through engagement with other CTSA hubs - where site engagement in subject recruitment and enrollment is the primary barrier. We are fortunate to have an engaged medical examiner at our site. Other sites may have specific models that work better in their locale, i.e. through ERs, clinics, community groups, utilizing different approaches to obtaining consent etc.

25	2016-11-21	70	\N	\N	Long-Term Nicotine Treatment for Mild Cognitive Impairment	MIND Study	\N	This study is a multi-site clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of transdermal nicotine in alleviating symptoms of MCI, designed to test the hypothesis that  nicotinic cholinergic receptor stimulation reliably produces enhancement in attentional functioning and memory. If the hypotheses are validated, these findings will support a novel, broadly available, and inexpensive repurposed intervention for MCI. The trial will consist of 24 months (plus a 3 week tapering off period) of randomized double-blind placebo-controlled treatment with nicotine or placebo in approximately 300 participants with MCI (150 per arm). This would be the longest trial of nicotine or nicotinic agonists to date and if successful would lead to combined trials with other symptomatic agents and/or agents that might directly interact with A? or tau-related mechanisms.	A Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in approximately 300 participants with MCI. Each subject will have up to a 28-day screening period, followed by 24 months and 3 weeks of treatment. 21mg Nicotine, or placebo, transdermal patches worn during waking hours. Active dose will titrate up from 3.5mg to 21mg in the first 6 weeks of treatment, remain at 21mg for 22.5 months, and then taper down in the final 3 weeks of treatment. CSF and MRI/fMRI sub-studies will be performed in approximately 50 participants each.	The study's aims are:   1. To test whether daily transdermal nicotine will produce sustained cognitive, clinical, and functional benefits for patients with MCI in a 2-year multi-center clinical trial.  2. To assess whether nicotine will influence the underlying biology related to MCI/AD by monitoring putative biological markers for AD development including structural/functional brain imaging and measures of AD pathology in spinal fluid.	The primary cognitive outcome measures will be the reaction time standard error change from baseline score on the Connors CPT. The primary outcome measure was chosen based on results of the pilot trial which showed a significant reduction in reaction time variability (standard error change) compared to baseline on the Connors CPT.     Key secondary outcomes include the clinical outcome measure MCI-CGIC (Clinical Global Impression of Change) score. Additional secondary measures including several measures from the Cogstate battery and paragraph recall will be collected.	\N	Participants must meet the following criteria:    1. Participant must have a subjective memory concern as reported by participant, study partner, or clinician    2. Abnormal memory function documented by scoring within the education adjusted ranges on the Logical Memory II subscale (Delayed Paragraph Recall)    from the Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised:    ? Less than or equal to 11 for 16 or more years of education    ? Less than or equal to 9 for 8 - 15 years of education    ? Less than or equal to 6 for 0 - 7 years of education    3. Mini-Mental State Exam score between 24 and 30, inclusive    4. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Global = 0.5. Memory Box score must be at least 0.5    5. General cognition and functional performance sufficiently preserved such that a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia cannot be made by the site clinician at the time of the screening visit    6. Age 55-90 (inclusive)    7. Stable permitted medications for 4 weeks or longer as specified in Section 6.10, including:    ? Memantine is allowable if stable for 12 weeks prior to screen    8. Geriatric Depression Scale score of less than or equal to 9    9. Study Partner is available who has frequent contact with the subject (e.g. an average of 10 hours per week or more), and can accompany the participant to most visits to answer questions about the participant    10. Adequate visual and auditory acuity to allow neuropsychological testing    11. Good general health with no additional diseases/disorders expected to interfere with the study    12. Participant is not pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential (i.e. women must be two years post-menopausal or surgically sterile)    13. Completed six grades of education or has a good work history    14. Must speak English fluently	Not provided	Nicotine will be administered as a transdermal patch. The technical description of this transdermal patch is as follows:    Nicotine will be delivered by a transdermal patch which is a transdermal delivery system for topical application, available in sizes of 10, 20, and 30 cm2 each containing 1.75 mg/cm2 of nicotine, releasing 7 mg, 14 mg and 21 mg respectively over 24 hours. During the first 6 weeks of treatment, the nicotine treatment group will have their dose level slowly increased (according to the table below) from 3.5mg to 21mg nicotine per day, administered via transdermal patch. They will remain at 21mg until the Month 24 visit, when they begin a 3-week tapering off period. The placebo group will receive the placebo comparator for the duration of the study.	Not provided	Not provided	There are no conflicts of interest for this study.	Randomization: Participants who have signed an informed consent and meet screening eligibility requirements will be randomly assigned using a 1:1 allocation ratio to nicotine or placebo by a random permuted block treatment assignment method, stratified by site.    Power and Sample Size Determination: Sample size calculations are based on the attention measure (reaction time standard error) change from baseline from the CPT. Six month change for the nicotine group was -0.04, and for the Placebo group was 0.018. Using the observed standard deviation of 0.16, an alpha level of 0.05, 122 participants per group would be needed to detect this difference with 80% power. This sample size would also provide at least 80% power to detect the observed differences from the pilot study for the CGIC (103 participants needed per group), and the principal measure of memory (delayed word recall) (64 participants needed per group). Anticipating dropouts of approximately 20-25% across the course of two years, the sample size will be increased to 150 participants enrolled per arm (300 total).    Statistical Analysis Plan: In general, biomarker and clinical outcome analyses will incorporate the modified intent-to-treat principle, namely, all randomized participants with both a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement will be included in the analysis while the safety analysis will be conducted on the intent-to-treat population (all randomized participants). All results will be reported as point estimates (proportions or mean differences across groups, as appropriate) and interval estimates (95% confidence intervals) with two-sided p-values denoting significance. No adjustments for multiple comparisons on secondary outcomes will be made and a p-value of 0.05 will be considered significant. Statistical analysis will be conducted using the statistical software R (www.r-project.org) or SAS.	Each site will receive a 3-Fold Brochure about the study, which they can personalize with their own contact information, a one-page flyer to post in doctor's offices and other public venues. They will also receive a letter that physicians can send to potential participants in their own practices and other physicians within their area that explains the study and asks for referrals, as well as a letter for physicians to send to their own patients. In addition, sites will receive a  press release that they can customize to their own site. All materials will include the mindstudy.org website. Vanderbilt University Medical Center is working with their public relations department who have local and national media relationships. The Vanderbilt site will be responsible for working on national recruitment efforts. Each site will work with their own local referral sources (i.e. physicians, memory clinics, etc.). The sites will need assistance in using publicity, public relations, minority recruitment, and engaging people who don't think they have a problem to be evaluated.

The CDS has been piloted and was found to be effective at Johns Hopkins Howard County.  We hypothesize that incorporating the CDS into workflow will improve time-to-sepsis-diagnosis, and will increase adherence to evidence-based guidelines on sepsis management.	We are seeking TIN consultation to receive guidance on our study protocol.  We would like to integrate a comprehensive clinical support system (CDS) into the Johns Hopkins electronic health record (EHR) that is aimed at improving sepsis diagnosis and management.  We have successfully completed a pilot/feasibility study at Johns Howard County (JHHC).  We would like to implement the CDS at JHH, JHBMC, and JHHC, and assess if the CDS improves time-to-sepsis-diagnosis, and/or adherence to evidence-based guidelines on sepsis management relative to the present standard of care. We anticipate that each hospital will serve as its own historical control (pre/post intervention).  This will be an unblinded trial (i.e., providers will know that they are using the CDS, but they will be blinded to the study results during the trial).	Primary Objective:  To assess if implementation of the CDS into the electronic health record improves time-to-sepsis-diagnosis and/or adherence to evidence-based guidelines on sepsis management (relative to the present standard of care).\n\nPotential Secondary Objectives: To assess if implementation of the CDS into the EHR/workflow improves the following (relative to the present standard of care):\n\n•\tPatient Mortality (inpatient mortality and 6 month mortiality)\n•\tHospital Length of Stay (LOS)\n•\tIntensive Care Unit LOS\n•\tHealth Care Resource Utilization\n•\tCost of Care\n•\tPatient/Provider Satisfaction	Primary End Points:\n•\tTime-to-sepsis-diagnosis\n•\tAdherence rate to guidelines on sepsis management\n\nPotential Secondary Endpoints:\n•\tPatient mortality (inpatient mortality, 6-month mortality)\n•\tHospital length of stay (LOS)\n•\tIntensive care unit LOS\n•\tHealthcare resource utilization\n•\tCost of care (to health system, payer, patient)\n•\tPatient/provider satisfaction	2	All patients 18 years of age and older who are seen in the JHH, JHBMC, or JHHC emergency department, or who are directly transferred to those hospitals (i.e., to the following units: ICUs, intermediate-care unit, general surgery unit, general medicine unit, general neurology unit) during the control year and intervention years, and who are identified as being 'at risk for sepsis' by the TREWScore. We may also include patient directly transferred to the Oncology and/or HIV units at JHH. We will not be studying patients in the Labor and Delivery department.	Enrollment Sites at JHH, JHBMC, JHHC in Maryland USA:  \n•\tEmergency Departments\n•\tICUs (surgical, medical, cardiac, neurological) \n•\tIntermediate-Care Units \n•\tGeneral Surgery Units \n•\tGeneral Medicine Units\n•\tGeneral Neurology Units\n\nPotential Additional Sites at JHH in Maryland USA:  \n•\tOncology Unit\n•\tHIV Unit	We conducted a pilot study on our clinical decision system (CDS) at JHHC, and found that it was feasible to link it with the Johns Hopkins electronic health record (EHR) system, and thereby guide workflow.   Our HIPAA compliant CDS uses a cloud-based architecture that integrates with EHR and:  a) alerts the healthcare team of patients at-risk for sepsis, b) provides data summaries on the given patients, and c) promotes and tracks task completion by the healthcare team based on evidence-based sepsis management guidelines.  The CDS identifies "at risk patients" by using the validated Targeted Real-Time Early Warning Score (TREWScore) developed by our team-a machine-learning based algorithm that uses real-time patient data to identify patients at risk for sepsis.  \n\nWe will be incorporating the CDS with the EHR at JHH, JHBMC, and JHHC during the study period, and will be monitoring for change in time-to-sepsis-diagnosis and adherence to sepsis management guidelines (as well as the potential secondary outcomes listed above).	In chronological order: \nMonths 0-1: Incorporate surveillance system into EHR.\nMonth 2-13:  Monitor primary and secondary outcomes before activating CDS.\nMonth 14-37:  Activate CDS and monitor primary and secondary outcomes.\nMonth 38-43:  Data analysis and manuscript generation	Patients will not be directly involved in the study.  We will prospectively collect participant data during their hospitalization via the CDS (Month 2-37).  We will obtain additional de-identified information (i.e., patient satisfaction scores, 6-month mortality, healthcare utilization/costs) from the Johns Hopkins Health System databases and/or publically available death records/registries. \n\nProviders and the healthcare team will be using the EHR/CDS based on their job description/patient care duties during the intervention period (Month 14-37).  The healthcare team will be asked to complete a satisfaction survey at the end of the intervention (Month 38).  Data endpoints will be measured at the hospital level (not at the individual provider level).	Dr. Saria and team developed the CDS being studied in the present trial, but will not receive financial compensation for implementing or evaluating the CDS.	\N	\N

202	2017-09-11	40	\N	\N	Dual Chamber ICDs vs. Single Chamber DEvices in OldeR PatieNts (DISCERN) Trial	DISCERN	4	The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) improves the survival of patients at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to cardiac arrest, hemodynamically significant sustained ventricular arrhythmias, or heart failure from ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, it remains unknown whether dual-chamber ICDs are superior to single-chamber ICDs at improving time to death or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes including heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, procedural complications, and device-related interventions. This pragmatic clinical trial will randomize 1700 patients in a 1:1 ratio to either 1) single-chamber ICD (n=850) and 2) dual-chamber ICD (n=850).	The DISCERN trial will be a pragmatic, comparative-effectiveness, multi-center, randomized clinical trial comparing single-chamber ICDs (i.e. those involving the insertion of a right ventricular lead) with dual-chamber ICDs (i.e. those involving the insertion of a right atrial lead and a right ventricular lead). This pragmatic clinical trial will randomize 1700 patients in a 1:1 ratio to either 1) single-chamber ICD (n=850) and 2) dual-chamber ICD (n=850). Patients will be consented, enrolled, randomized and then followed every 6 months for endpoint assessment.	Primary Objective:\nTo determine if dual-chamber ICDs, as compared with single-chamber ICDs, improve time to death and or hospitalization for any of the following cardiovascular causes: heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, procedural complications, and device-related invasive interventions.\n\nSecondary Objective:\nTo compare differences between the two randomized arms for components of the primary endpoint, inappropriate ICD shocks, rate of right ventricular pacing, and quality of life.	The primary endpoint of the DISCERN trial is time to death or hospitalization for any of the following cardiovascular causes: heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, procedural complications, and device-related invasive interventions. Atrial fibrillation is defined as an irregular rhythm with no discernible p waves, has to be captured by an ECG or continuous telemetry recording, and has to be of 1 hour duration based on symptoms and/or length of recording (i.e. capturing atrial fibrillation on an ICD electrogram will not be enough). Stroke is defined as a neurologic deficit lasting for more than 24 hours with or without radiologic deficit. Procedural complications may include cardiac perforation with or without tamponade, pneumothorax, hemothorax, myocardial infarction/stroke (if defibrillation threshold testing is performed), lead dislodgement requiring revision or replacement, ICD pocket hematoma that requires an invasive intervention (like evacuation or blood transfusion), and infection). Device-related invasive interventions may include adding a new lead to an existing device, replacing a lead, repositioning an existing lead, adjusting a loose setscrew (where the lead inserts into the header of the device), and replacing the device. \n\nSecondary endpoints include the components of the primary endpoint in addition to inappropriate ICD shocks, rate of right ventricular pacing, and quality of life.	1	A total of 1700 patients will be enrolled in the DISCERN trial. These patients should meet the following enrollment criteria: \n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1)\tPatients scheduled for an ICD for a CMS approved indication\n2)\tBe at least 65 years of age\n3)\tPatients with left ventricular dysfunction need to be on guideline-recommended medical therapy including ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and Beta-blockers. \n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1)\tContraindication for ICD placement, for example those with\na.\tCardiac revascularization in the past 3 months in patients receiving a primary prevention ICD\nb.\tA Class I indication for dual-chamber pacing like sick sinus syndrome, second or 3rd degree AV block\nc.\tPermanent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (patients with persistent atrial fibrillation/flutter will be allowed)\n2)\tEstimated life expectancy of <1 year from a non-cardiac cause\n3)\tPregnant women or those with childbearing potential and not using a reliable method of contraception\n4)\tInability to give a written informed consent	We have engaged 35 geographically diverse sites to ensure good representation of different regions in the United States. To be selected for the DISCERN trial, a site has to be an active participant in the NCDR ICD Registry and has to have experience in randomized clinical trials with good performance in enrolling patients and collecting and submitting data to the DCRI in a timely fashion. Table 4 of the synopsis shows the sites that we have engaged with projected enrollment based on a survey of these sites. We will continue to work on identifying more sites that meet our selection criteria mentioned above to reach a goal of up to 50 sites.  We anticipate that up to 10 sites may be in Canada .	The DISCERN trial will compare single-chamber ICDs with dual-chamber ICDs. Because our RCT is focused on older patients who are more likely to require pacing that cannot be provided by subcutaneous ICDs, we do not include subcutaneous ICDs as a comparator in our trial. Clinical trials of subcutaneous ICDs enrolled relatively younger patients with a mean age of 54 years. Although leadless pacemakers can be added to subcutaneous ICDs, those do not offer atrial pacing and as such are far from ideal for patients with sick sinus syndrome who are not in permanent atrial fibrillation.\n\nSingle- and dual-chamber ICDs are the comparators in this trial as the controversy surrounding the best type of ICD addressed in this research only applies to single and dual-chamber ICDs. This controversy does not apply to ICDs with cardiac resynchronization therapy (devices with a right ventricular lead and a left ventricular lead), a therapy for heart failure, as there is consensus that inserting an atrial lead (in addition to the right and left ventricular leads) is the best approach in the vast majority of recipients of this type of device. \nAll ICDs on the market today are capable of bradycardia pacing and tachycardia detection and treatment. For bradycardia pacing, single-chamber ICDs will be programmed in VVI-40 (V=pacing in right ventricle, V=sensing in right ventricle, and I=inhibition of pacing by sensed native beats, 40 bpm pacing rate). Dual-chamber ICDs will be programmed in AAI-50 (A=pacing in right atrium, A=sensing in right atrium, and I=inhibition of pacing by sensed native beats, 50 bpm pacing rate). Because a high burden of right ventricular pacing could lead to cardiomyopathy in about 30% of patients, one of our main goals is to minimize right ventricular pacing in both arms of the study. Because some differences exist in programming features of ICDs manufactured by different vendors, we will mandate programming parameters that will make these devices as similar as possible. In devices that allow managed ventricular pacing (MVP) by pacing in AAI mode and switching to DDD (D=pacing in right atrium and right ventricle, D=sensing in right atrium and right ventricle, and D=dual response to sensing) pacing mode only if the patient has 2 consecutive non-conducted p waves, we will require this feature to be turned on. In devices that do not have the MVP feature, pacing mode will be AAI-50 and if type 2 second degree atrioventricular block (AVB) or third degree AVB is developed in follow-up, we will require that AAI be switched to DDD. In that circumstance, if a patient develops NYHA class I, II or III heart failure symptoms, pacing in the right ventricle >40-50% of the time and an LVEF <50%, physicians will be encouraged to change the patient's device to a biventricular device based on the results of the Biventricular versus Right Ventricular Pacing in Heart Failure Patients with Atrioventricular Block (BLOCK-HF) trial.67 Once this occurs, follow-up for that patient will be censored. Tachycardia detection and therapies align with evidence on optimal programming of ICDs derived from recent randomized clinical trials.	Enrollment will begin in the third quarter of the first year and is expected to take 430 months. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 30 months, and data collection and final data analysis are expected to be completed 6472 months from the start of enrollment	Study participants will be screened, enrolled, and, randomized during the index encounter. Sites will be asked to limit the time from enrollment/randomization to ICD implantation to 1-2 weeks. After ICD implantation, there will be no scheduled face-to-face study visits. All study patients will be followed on a usual care basis. Sites will be asked to complete a brief electronic data collection form during the first post-ICD implantation visit (the timing of which will be per standard of care) that will be uploaded directly into the electronic data collection. The form will capture information on peri-procedure complications.  Every 6 months patients will be contacted by the DCRI Call Center to document vital status, medications, and hospitalizations. For a randomly selected subset of 400 patients, quality of life will be assessed by the DCRI Call Center at 12 and 24 months. Hospital records will be obtained to ascertain the accuracy of self-reported data. Data downloaded from ICDs will be saved and uploaded directly into the study database. The last patient enrolled will be followed for 30 months.	\N	Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio within a site to either a dual-chamber or a single-chamber ICD.  Patients will be followed throughout the study period until a common study stop date. Data will be analyzed according to the Intention-to-treat principle.\nThis study is designed to test whether a dual-chamber ICD is superior to a single-chamber ICD in reducing the primary endpoint of time to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalizations. The following assumptions were used to obtain the total sample size of 1,700 patients:\n1) The 3-year rate of the primary endpoint in the single-chamber ICD arm is 35%.\n2) The primary endpoint will be reduced by 25% with a dual-chamber ICD (i.e. hazard ratio of 0.75).\n3) 2-sided Type I error of 0.05\n4) Loss to follow-up about 8% over 3 years or ~2.5% per year\n\nAssuming enrollment over a 15 months will result in power of approximately 85%. Assuming enrollment over 30 months will result in approximately 80% power. The randomly selected cohort of 400 participants for the quality of life substudy will provide approximately 75%-90% power to detect clinically meaningful differences (i.e. 4 points) on the Duke Activity Status Index instrument. \n\nBaseline demographic and clinical variables will be summarized for each arm of the study. Descriptive summaries of the distribution of continuous variables will be presented in terms of percentiles (e.g., median, 25th and 75th percentiles), while discrete variables will be summarized in terms of frequencies and percentages. \n\nThe comparison of the 2 randomized arms with respect to the primary endpoint will be a time-to-event analysis, and therefore will be based on the time from randomization to all-cause death. The Cox proportional hazards regression model will be the primary tool to assess outcome differences between the two treatment arms. The Cox model will include an indicator variable for treatment group, reason for ICD implantation, history of atrial fibrillation, age, and sex.\n\nDISCERN is a large, multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate a therapy that may improve survival and major morbidity. Therefore, it fits the profile of a trial requiring an independent DSMB. An interim examination of key safety and effectiveness endpoint data will be performed at regular intervals during the course of the trial. The results of the interim analyses and status reports will be carefully and confidentially reviewed by an NHLBI-appointed DSMB. The DSMB will meet at 6-month intervals to review the accumulating data. We propose that the DSMB focuses on the endpoint of all-cause mortality. Given that both single- and dual-chamber ICDs are commonly used in clinical practice, we recommend that the DSMB applies the conservative Haybittle-Peto boundary for their review of the all-cause mortality endpoint. It is anticipated that the DSMB will review detailed safety data every 6 months once enrollment has commenced. A separate DSMB charter will outline the operating guidelines for the committee, and the protocol for evaluation of data.	We do not anticipate any challenges with recruitment and expect to have a full list of 50 sites who have indicated an interest in participating in the trial at time of application.
360	2018-06-28	55	\N	t	A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Pragmatic Trial of Surveillance versus Endoscopic Eradication Therapy for Patients with Barrett's Esophagus and Low-Grade Dysplasia - The SURVENT Trial	Surveillance versus endoscopic therapy for Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia	6	Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the most feared complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Barrett's esophagus (BE), a metaplastic change of the esophageal lining, is the only known precursor to EAC.  Endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) can ablate BE, and decrease the risk of EAC.  However, the benefits of EET versus endoscopic surveillance are unclear. The 2009 Institute of Medicine report identified "upper endoscopy utilization in GERD patients" as #4 in its top 100 priority topics for comparative effectiveness research.  Unfortunately, no substantial investigation of this topic has occurred since that time, making this one of the most pressing unmet research needs. We propose to conduct a multicenter, randomized controlled pragmatic trial of endoscopic surveillance versus EET in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) and low-grade dysplasia (LGD). This study will directly inform an important, everyday treatment decision faced by patients, caregivers and their clinicians.	We intend to propose a multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial of EET versus endoscopic surveillance for patients with BE and LGD. \n\n\nEligible patients will undergo centralized randomization with a 1:1 allocation ratio to one of these two arms. The randomization sequence will be generated centrally at the Data Coordinating Center. In order to maximize generalizability, a pragmatic study design has been adopted which focuses on only one protocol-driven intervention - randomization to EET or surveillance. All subsequent relevant clinical decisions are deferred to treating physicians as per usual care. However, to ensure a consistency in level of care across practices, a set of best practices espoused in the recent American Gastroenterological Association document to guide diagnosis and management of LGD will be disseminated across all sites. \n\nIn addition, this research initiative will also include a prospective cohort study in which patients with BE and LGD who decline randomization in the randomized controlled trial but undergo EET or endoscopic surveillance, and are willing to participate, will be followed longitudinally. While the cohort group will not directly inform the primary outcome, they will contribute to the biorepository and aid in identification of factors associated with neoplastic progression and response to therapy.\n\nWe will define PROs that will serve as critical endpoints in the RCT and cohort study. This approach will integrate multiple data collection methods from varied stakeholders to develop relevant concepts and define and validate instruments. A SAG will be established and will include representatives from the following groups: patients and caregivers, endoscopists, cardiothoracic/GI oncology surgeons and oncologists, health administrators, policymakers, industry and patient advocacy groups. Patients and caregivers will be identified using on-line support groups. These individuals will be actively engaged via surveys, interviews and focus groups. The overarching objective is to determine which management approach is better as defined by both traditional clinical endpoints and robust PRO measures. The planning phase will also include a pilot study at select participating centers to assess patient willingness to participate and undergo randomization which will demonstrate feasibility and also help us determine our sample size calculation.	Primary Objective(s): \nWe propose to conduct a multicenter, randomized controlled pragmatic trial of endoscopic surveillance versus EET in patients with BE and LGD. This study will directly inform an important, everyday treatment decision faced by patients, caregivers and their clinicians. \nOur specific aims include: (i) To compare the effectiveness of two established approaches for the management of patients with BE with LGD, endoscopic surveillance and EET, using accepted clinical endpoints (neoplastic progression rates, adverse events and recurrence rates). Hypothesis: patients undergoing EET will demonstrate less neoplastic progression and EAC than those undergoing endoscopic surveillance.\n\nSecondary Objective(s): \n(i)To compare PROs, as defined and prioritized by patients, caregivers, clinicians and other key stakeholders, in patients with BE and LGD treated with EET or undergoing surveillance. Hypothesis: patients treated with EET will experience increased psychological well-being and improved quality of life (QOL) despite added procedural risks and healthcare encounters compared to the surveillance arm. (ii) To establish a tissue repository of patients with LGD that includes esophageal biopsy specimens, blood and saliva with the goal of identifying biomarkers associated with the highest risk of progression in this patient population. Hypothesis: biomarkers can assist in risk-stratification of patients with BE with LGD.	The primary clinical endpoint for this study is the neoplastic progression rate, defined as the occurrence of high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/mucosal EAC/invasive EAC at any time during the study period following enrollment. Secondary clinical endpoints include progression rates to invasive EAC alone, complete eradication rates for both BE and dysplasia, adverse events and recurrence rates. PROs defined through the Engagement Initiative during the U34 timeframe and endorsed by the Study Advisory Group (SAG) will be included as critical endpoints in this study.  PROs will likely include: burden of intervention (number of endoscopies, number of clinic visits, pain/discomfort related to the intervention), change in QOL scores (using PROMIS Global and SF-12 scales), level of anxiety and depression among patients and caregivers [Worry of Cancer Scale (WOCS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)] and lost productivity for patients and caregivers.	1	Eligibility\nPatients with BE and LGD who provide informed consent will be eligible for enrollment\n\nInclusion criteria:\n1.\tAge ≥ 18 years\n2.\tBiopsies within the previous 12 months demonstrating BE and LGD\n3.\tConfirmation of LGD by expert central pathology panel\n\nExclusion criteria:\n1.\tPregnancy\n2.\tPrior EET for BE\n3.\tHistory of HGD/EAC\n4.\tActive esophagitis (LA Grade B or higher grades) or stricture precluding passage of an upper endoscope\n5.\tEsophageal varices or known history of portal hypertension\n6.\tUncontrolled coagulopathy\n7.\tLife expectancy of <2 years as judged by site investigator\n\nPotential patients will be evaluated in the clinic setting at participating institutions for a discussion regarding risks and benefits of treatment options. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be offered the opportunity to participate in the trial. At that time, the objectives of the study, as well as the risks and benefits of enrolling, will be explained in detail to potential subjects.	The PIs have conducted several important NIH and GI society-funded studies in the field of BE and BE-related neoplasia that have broadly impacted clinical practice worldwide. This includes the first randomized controlled trial demonstrating the efficacy of ablation in BE patients with dysplasia, several studies describing the effectiveness and safety of EET and establishing Quality Indicators for EET for BE-related neoplasia patients. The PIs have first-authored GI society guidelines for the management of patients with BE and EET for patients with BE-related neoplasia. The PIs have a strong working relationship and have developed a robust platform for the design and conduct of high-impact multicenter RCTs, on budget and on time.\n\nThe PIs have assembled a network of collaborators who are world leaders in BE.  Included centers have demonstrated a strong research interest in BE and published impactful studies in this field. \n\nPotential collaborating sites:\nUniversity of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina\nNorthwestern University, Chicago, Illinois\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California\nCase Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio\nMayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, Minnesota\nKaiser Permanente, San Francisco, San Francisco, California\nCleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio\nColumbia University, New York, New York\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nMedical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Charleston, South Carolina\nMayo Clinic Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida\nVeterans Affairs Medical Center, White River Junction, Vermont\nWashington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri\nGeisinger Health Care System, Danville, Pennsylvania\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, Washington\nJohns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland\nGastrointestinal Associates, Knoxville, Tennessee \n\nAll these centers have the clinical experience and are high-volume centers for management of BE-related neoplasia patients. In addition, each center has established clinical research resources that will be augmented during the U34 funding period to the level necessary to conduct this study to the highest methodologic and regulatory standards. All site investigators have expressed interest in participating in this landmark randomized controlled trial.\n\nDescription of experience of collaborating sites in successfully conducting clinical studies\nThe proposed collaborating sites have demonstrated the capacity and infrastructure to work effectively and efficiently together in conducting multicenter clinical trials of the highest quality in the field of BE. Over 50% of the sites participated in the seminal trial demonstrating the efficacy if this method in patients with BE and HGD published in NEJM in 2009, demonstrating their ability to work collaboratively to produce high quality endoscopic research. All collaborating sites and site PIs have high-volume BE and EAC units with proven track records in endoscopy research. All these sites will have the appropriate study population to be able to contribute an adequate number of subjects to the study to meet the enrollment target of 6-8 subjects/month.	The safety of endoscopic eradication therapy has been well defined in multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Similarly, the safety of surveillance endoscopy with biopsies is well-established. Perhaps the most serious concern is the risk of progression to invasive cancer in patients enrolled in the surveillance arm. However, available data clearly demonstrate that endoscopic surveillance usually detects progression to HGD/EAC at a stage amenable to EET, and rarely requires esophagectomy. Our Safety Analysis Plan and robust monitoring apparatus will ensure rigorous capture of adverse event data and thus allowing an unbiased appraisal of risks associated with these procedures.	5 years	3-5 years	No conflicts of interest	An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be utilized. The time to progression will be calculated from the time of randomization (RCT)/enrollment (COHORT) until the endoscopy date on which HGD/mucosal EAC/invasive EAC is detected. The proportional event rates during follow-up will be compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. Risk differences will be calculated as the differences in proportional event rates during follow-up. Number needed to treat (NNT) will be calculated as 1 divided by the risk difference. For all pre-specified analyses, a final two-sided p<0.05 will indicate statistical significance. Fisher's exact test or chi-squared test will be used to assess differences between the two groups for analysis of the primary endpoint of proportion of patients with neoplastic progression. Categorical variables will be compared using the Fisher exact test and continuous variables will be compared using the t-test (normal distribution) or Mann-Whitney test (skewed distribution). A subgroup analysis will be conducted to identify risk factors of progression and absence of LGD during follow-up using logistic regression analyses. Baseline variables (demographics, BE length, presence of visible lesions, confirmed LGD, multifocal LGD, and center differences) will be identified with a forward stepwise selection strategy using the likelihood ratio statistic, with a p value <0.10 as the criterion level for selection. No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons. Adverse events will be categorized using MedDRA classification, and described using the categorical analysis described above. Logistic regression analysis will be performed to assess risk factors for common adverse events, including esophageal strictures. The analytic plan will be adjusted for all PROs defined during the Engagement Approach and planning phase. All exploratory analyses will be interpreted more conservatively using a significance level of 0.01.	\N
70	2016-12-07	3	\N	\N	Optimizing selection and management of cardiac arrest patients treated with ECMO	ECMO Study	\N	This proposal addresses the knowledge gap around the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for cardiac arrest (called eCPR), including patient selection, post-arrest therapies and management. eCPR patients routinely undergo complex therapies as part of their care. These therapies include hypothermia/normothermia, immediate invasive coronary angiography, and require coordinated care of multidisciplinary clinical teams. Furthermore, ECMO for cardiac arrest (eCPR) is rapidly increasing across the US and the world. We showed that US centers performing eCPR have increased >200% in the last 5 years and the number of patients receiving eCPR has increased >2.5 fold over the same period. Despite complex care and rapidly expanding use, there are currently no multi-site or comprehensive data on prior health status, phenotype, ECMO method, timing, duration, and outcome in patients treated with ECMO for cardiac arrest.    Our central hypothesis is that patient selection characteristics and post cardiac arrest management are correlated with neurologically intact survival.  Systematic data collection and outcome analysis will determine appropriate patient selection and define eCPR protocols to inform clinical trial design. To address this need, this health services research project will collect multi-center observational data on the patient selection and management of cardiac arrest patients treated with ECMO.	This is a prospective observational study. Each site will be given a site specific code and additional participant numbered identifiers, and treating ER physicians will be shown the range of data to be collected for each patient. Patient and treatment data collected will be derived from a combination of medical record review and study specific standardized data forms used at the time of Emergency Room eCPR performance. Resuscitation 'scribes' at each site will complete study form to record time to ECMO, vitals data, and concurrent therapy.  Other data will be extracted from the medical record. Where possible, the treating physician will complete a brief post-treatment interview to lend insight into factors involved in patient selection.      Patient and treatment data will be entered using uniform fields in a REDCap database. As the coordinating center, the University of Utah will monitor data from all sites for completeness and accuracy. Each site will maintain participant records that conform to HIPAA policy. Data is maintained and entered via password protected computers at each site. Data collection central website and access security will be maintained by the University of Utah. Data collection sheets are stored in secure offices at all sites. Data will be considered a 'limited data set' with coded identifiers generated by individual sites.	1)     Pilot observational study of eCPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated in the Emergency Room and hospital. We will prospectively and sequentially collect data on each instance of eCPR use at up to 20 sites (4-8 patients/year/site), 7 of which are already identified CTSA sites. We will collect data to include patient medical history, comorbid disease, cardiac disease indices, quantitative cardiac function, selection, eCPR implementation, post arrest therapies and management.    2)     Define physician factors that determine patient selection and post arrest management for eCPR. There is known heterogeneity in both patient selection and post eCPR management. At participating sites, we will assess physician attitudes to the use of ECMO for cardiac arrest, including patient selection and post arrest management. Completion of this Aim will further define physician acceptance of various eCPR trial designs and care pathways.	Neurologic performance based on Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score.  Good outcome will be defined as CPC 1 or 2. Death will be defined as CPC 5. Categorization will be determined based on review of the medical record, with preference given to neurological opinion followed by opinion of treating physician.	1	Inclusion Criteria:    a)      Adults greater than or equal to 18 years of age    b)      Out of hospital cardiac arrest that is refractory to treatment by emergency medical services and emergency department personnel    c)      ECMO commences within 90 minutes of the initial collapse      Inclusion criteria have been left broad because this study seeks to recognize correlation between pre-morbid medical conditions and the decision factors in ECMO treatment with neurologically intact outcome.	Not provided	Observational study.  ECMO for cardiac arrest is the intervention.	Not provided	Not provided	\N	To be determined.  Working to develop a statistical model.     The number of subjects enrolled will be dependent on the statistical power, yet to be determined.   Our target enrollment is 200 patients.        Data:    Control Group: Neurologically intact survival after 20 minutes of CPR is <1%    Intervention Group: Neurologically intact survival after 20 minutes of CPR, followed by ECMO placement, is 30-50% in small series, including our own experience.	Enrollment Plan: Patients will be enrolled if brought to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and meeting Inclusion/Exclusion criteria.

The brain retains the potential for neuroplasticity in old age, so interventions that enhance neuroplasticity may remediate age-related cognitive decline. Stress and (in) activity are key predictors of decline via neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic, and neurotrophin changes that are targets for intervention. Therefore, two promising interventions are Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and exercise. In this study, we will randomize healthy older adults with cognitive decline to one of four conditions: MBSR, multi-component intensity-based exercise, and their combination, compared to a discussion (control) group.	The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of four interventions on age-related cognitive decline in healthy older adults. We will examine the effects of 1. MBSR, 2. multi-component intensity-based exercise, and 3. the combination of MBSR and exercise compared to 4. a discussion (control) group. We will randomize 580 non-demented healthy adults aged 65+, in a 2x2 factorial design, to one of four conditions noted above. The study will consist of a 6-month acute intervention phase followed by a 12-month maintenance phase with monthly classes and other prompts to maintain intervention behaviors.  Assessments include cognitive tests, biomarkers, neuroimaging assessments, functional assessments to examine real-world benefits of the interventions, and other behavioral assessments to characterize participants and pave the way for further exploratory analyses.	Aim 1: Examine effects of MBSR, exercise, and their combination for remediation of memory and cognitive control, with secondary outcomes of everyday cognition, functional performance, and social participation and engagement.   We hypothesize that MBSR and exercise will each produce benefits in healthy older adults' cognitive performance, and combined MBSR with exercise will show greater cognitive improvements than either intervention alone.  Aim 2: Examine mechanistic changes that underlie cognitive remediation from MBSR and exercise.  We hypothesize a) a decrease in peak cortisol accounts for improvements with MBSR and b) increased insulin sensitivity, aerobic fitness, and BDNF account for improvements with exercise.  Aim 3: Examine whether the interventions cause changes in brain structure and structural connectivity and whether these plastic changes help to explain the cognitive improvements.  We hypothesize that improved functional connectivity within and across specific cognitive networks and increased volume of hippocampal and lateral prefrontal regions account for improved cognitive function with the interventions.  Aim 4: Examine predictors of variability in response to the interventions.  We hypothesize that baseline cortisol and insulin sensitivity will predict degree of cognitive remediation from MBSR and exercise: that is, high baseline cortisol will predict greater improvement from MBSR, while low insulin sensitivity will predict greater improvement from exercise.	Our primary outcome timepoint is 6 months, although this is approximately three months after the end of acute MBSR, because (1) MBSR's benefits are not expected to end immediately after the acute intervention; all of our preliminary studies found retained or increased benefits at three-month follow-up; (2) the project addresses neuroplasticity changes which are not fully obtainable until an intervention has been maximally effective for at least three months, which is the time stem cells need to differentiate into neurons. We also assess cognition at 3 months to provide an 'acute' MBSR endpoint, consistent with literature comparing interventions with different time scales. Secondary outcomes test intervention effects on everyday cognition (Cognitive concerns and Executive function), activity performance (OTDL-R), and social participation/engagement scales.	1	Inclusion criteria:   -Community-living men and women age 65 to 84   -Self-reported cognitive complaints that are a normal part of aging  -No current meditation practice nor prior training in it  -Sedentary (per PI discretion)  Exclusion criteria:  -Known diagnosis of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, other clinical neurodegenerative illness (e.g., Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular disease), psychotic disorder, or any unstable psychiatric condition  -Medical conditions that suggest shortened lifespan, such as metastatic cancer; or would prohibit safe participation in the interventions, including cardiovascular disease or musculoskeletal conditions; or would interfere with the assessments, such as taking medications for diabetes or ferromagnetic metal/bridgework that would interfere with MRI signal  -IQ <70 as estimated by the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading  -Sensory impairment (language, hearing, or visual) that would prevent participation  -Alcohol abuse within 6 months  -Current illicit drug use  -Concurrent cognitive training, such as brain-training software, or other interventions expected to affect neuroplasticity  -Medications that interfere with measurements, including cancer chemotherapy, glucocorticoids, and interferon  -Inability to cooperate with protocol	In addition to Washington University in St. Louis, there is one additional external participating site - UCSD.   The study does not intend to include sites outside of the United States.	The four intervention conditions in this study are (1) MBSR, (2) intensity-focused multi-component exercise, (3) combined MBSR and exercise, and (4) Health Education (a control condition).  1. MBSR Intervention: Content includes instruction in mindfulness meditation practices, gentle mindful movement, and exercises to enhance mindfulness in everyday life. We use A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Workbook as a companion guide. Participants get daily at-home assignments with recordings of meditative practices. Subjects may be asked to track their daily practice on an electronic data collection device (tablet or personal device via status/post through REDCap) or by paper and pencil. We will ask if they are adhering to their home practice and intervene with prompts and counseling for those not keeping up with their home practice. Subjects will be asked to practice MBSR at home, with the goal of working up to 1 hour of practice per day.  2. Exercise Condition: Under the direct supervision of trained exercise instructors (three instructors per group), the exercise protocol is optimal for improving aerobic fitness and insulin sensitivity in older adults, as well as improving strength and balance and reducing indices of frailty. Each session consists of aerobic exercises and resistance training to improve fitness and insulin sensitivity, and exercises to improve balance, mobility, and flexibility which are an essential part of an exercise program in this age group. The rationale for our focus on multiple components rather than only one, such as aerobic exercise alone, is that aerobic exercise and resistance training each change these putative pathways and have been shown to improve cognitive function in older adults. Participants will complete 1 repetition max measurements (1RMs), determining the maximum amount of weight they can lift in one repetition at baseline, 6 months, and 18 months. Participants will record physiological and exercise information obtained during in-person exercise classes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, minutes of aerobic activity, etc.  Type Exercises Description  Aerobic  Treadmill, elliptical, bikes  Participants exercise so that their heart rate is approximately 65% of their peak heart rate and gradually increase the intensity of exercise with the goal of achieving a heart rate between 70 and 85% peak.  Progressive resistance training  Weight-lifting machines and functional movements  Participants perform 1- or-2 sets at a resistance of approximately 65% of their one-repetition maximum, with 8-to-12 repetitions of each exercise; they will gradually increase the volume and intensity with a goal of 2-to-3 sets at a resistance of approximately 80% of their one-repetition maximum, with 6-to-8 repetitions of each exercise. Also functional resistance training using whole body movements with either light weights or body weight as resistance.  Balance/mobility  Dynamic movements that challenge postural stability and mobility  Various gait patterns; walking on uneven terrain (simulated indoors, or outside); maneuvering around obstacles; use of stability balls for seated 'core' work; weight transfer forward/backward, side-to-side; eye tracking movements while seated, standing, slow walking.  Participants will also be prescribed 120 minutes of home exercise each week. The aerobic component will consist of walking, using exercise DVDs, and/or other aerobic activities; additionally, participants will be given a rotation of exercise activities for strength and balance-training exercises practiced in class that can be done safely at home. Subjects may be asked to track their daily practice on an electronic data collection device (tablet or personal device via status/post through REDCap) or by paper and pencil. We will ask if they are adhering to their home exercise and intervene with prompts and counseling for those not keeping up with their home exercise.  MBSR and Exercise condition: This condition will receive both MBSR and exercise as described above. In addition, 120 minutes of at-home exercise each week as well as daily, at-home mindfulness practice of up to 1 hour will be assigned and may be asked to be tracked via the tablet, personal device, or paper and pencil.  4. Health Education: This is a group-based intervention that increases health-related knowledge and action. Health Education improves chronic disease management, but it does not teach mindfulness techniques and does not involve exercise.	The study opened to enrollment in March 2015.  We expect to meet the target accrual in March 2019.  We expect to complete data analysis in 2021.	It will take 20 months for each individual participant to complete all participant visits.	The research team members have no financial ties or other financial conflicts of interest related to this study.	The 2x2 factorial design is optimal for testing the effects of each intervention and for testing the combined and interactive effects. Prior to inferential testing, baseline characteristics will be examined, frequency distributions will be produced, and measures of central tendency and variability will be estimated on each continuous measure. We will follow the intention-to-treat rule for main effects hypotheses, and we will include site as a factor in all of the analyses. All power analyses were conducted with G*Power 3.1 and assume 15% attrition for power calculations. Consistent with conventions for factorial designs, we Bonferroni-adjust for number of primary outcomes (two-tailed ?=0.025) but not for number of conditions.	Both clinical centers are actively recruiting participants and each site enrolls approximately 8 patients per month. We expect to complete enrollment by March 2019 based on prior study enrollment data. At this time (June 2017), we have enrolled approximately 50% of our target accrual.

While the focus of this study is on improving the translation of two clinical interventions for OUDS, we anticipate the CCT could be applied to patients hospitalized with other chronic conditions for which multiple clinical disciplines play important roles in treatment.  The two evidence-based interventions to be implemented are medication assisted treatment (MAT) and re-engineered discharge planning (RED).	This is a Phase 3 multi-site randomized controlled trial of the CCT approach relative to UC, stratified on prior MAT use, with the patient as the unit of randomization. Eight hundred sixty-four patients total from three hospitals (Cedars Sinai Medical Center, University of New Mexico, and Baystate Health) will be randomized to receive either CCT or UC.	The main intent of this study is to determine whether an interdisciplinary, collaborative care team (CCT) increases the T3 translation of evidence-based interventions for opioid use disorders (OUD) relative to usual care (UC) in hospitalized patients with OUDs, improving patient outcomes.  We hypothesize that patients randomized to the CCT arm will have higher rates of MAT initiation and successful linkage to follow-up OUD treatment (primary outcomes) than those receiving UC.  We will also examine the effect of the CCT on completed after-hospital care plans, OUD treatment engagement, MAT utilization post hospital discharge, linkage to outpatient medical care; rehospitalization and emergency department use, and self-reported opioid misuse 30 days post-hospital discharge	Primary outcomes:\n1)\tAssessment of MAT initiation rates in hospital.\n     a)\tPrimary Endpoint 1: Proportion of patients in each intervention arm who initiate MAT prior to discharge, defined as use of any FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for OUD, including buprenorphine, naltrexone and methadone.  \n2)\tAssessment of successful linkage to follow up outpatient OUD treatment following discharge from hospital using the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) initiation measure. https://ecqi.healthit.gov/ecqm/measures/cms137v4 \n     a)\tPrimary Endpoint 2: Proportion of patients in each intervention arm who attend at least one OUD-related visit within 14 days of hospital discharge (± 14 days)\n\nSecondary outcomes: \n1)\tAssessment of the frequency of patients receiving after-hospital care plans at time of discharge.\n     a)\tSecondary Endpoint 1: Proportion of patients with an after-hospital care plan that specifies a date and time for an addiction care appointment at the time of discharge \n2)\tAssessment of successful engagement in outpatient OUD treatment following discharge from hospital using HEDIS engagement measure. https://ecqi.healthit.gov/ecqm/measures/cms137v4\n     a)\tSecondary Endpoint 2: Proportion of patients in each intervention arm who initiate and who had two or more additional OUD-related visits within 30 days of initiation (± 14 days).\n3)\tAssessment of initiation or continuation of MAT treatment post hospital discharge \n     a)\tSecondary Endpoint 3: Proportion of patients in each intervention arm who initiate or continue MAT treatment within 14 days (± 14 days) following hospital discharge.\n4)\tAssessment of successful linkage to follow-up medical care\n     a)\tSecondary Endpoint 4: Proportion of patients in each intervention arm who complete at least one visit to an outpatient medical provider within 30 days of hospital discharge (± 14 days).\n5)\tAssessment of rehospitalization and Emergency Department (ED) rates. \n     a)\tSecondary Endpoint 5: Proportion of patients in each intervention arm who are re-hospitalized or revisit the ED within 90 days following discharge. \n6)\tOpioid use\n     a)\tSecondary Endpoint 6: Proportion of patients in each intervention arm who self-report opioid misuse in the 30 days post discharge.	1	Inclusion Criteria--Subjects will be eligible if they meet the following criteria:  \n1)\tAdmitted to an inpatient hospital bed\n2)\tAge 18 or older \n3)\tOUD diagnosis, defined by scores of >3 on the opioid section of the World Health Organization (WHO) Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening test (ASSIST). \n4)\tAttending physician agrees to involvement of CCT and enrollment of patient in study\n5)\tSpeak and understand English or Spanish. \n6)\tHave capacity to give informed consent\n7)\tProvision of a signed and dated informed consent form \n\nExclusion Criteria--Subjects will be excluded if they:\n1)\tAre in active, stable treatment with MAT, as confirmed by the treating provider. \n2)\tAre admitted to an observation bed with an expected length of stay of less than 48 hours	The project will involve collaboration among three Clinical Translational Science Award sites in three diverse geographic locations of the United States, including California (Cedars-Sinai), Massachusetts (Bay State), and New Mexico (UNM).	Overview\nThe purpose of the proposed intervention, the Collaborative Care Team (CCT), is to translate evidence based interventions into the care of patients in the hospital setting. The CCT does not replace the function of primary teams. Rather, the CCT supports the ability of the primary team to translate effective treatments in the hospital environment. The consultative model enables the CCT service to deliver more than the sum of its parts, translating effective care for a greater population than would be possible if it were a primary service. The consultative orientation also suggests an adaptive approach, responding to the care setting, the questions of the primary service, and most importantly the needs of the patient. Such flexibility is vital in the hospital setting, where successful interventions must be interwoven in an environment characterized by multiple demands involving primary services, testing, procedures, complications, and requirements for efficiency. \n\nThe proposed CCT intervention has four core attributes: \n1)\tMultidisciplinary: The CCT is multidisciplinary. The essential members of the team include an addiction medicine specialist and a care manager.  The CCT team supports and interacts with the medical team physician overseeing the patient's care during hospitalization, such as a hospitalist, surgeon, or other specialist.\n2)\tPopulation-focused:   The CCT will use a clinical registry to track the care of the population of hospitalized patients with an OUD.   The focus on a population encourages the team to be proactive (rather than just reactive to narrow consultative requests), and to coordinate care beyond the hospital encounter. \n3)\tMeasurement-based: The CCT uses standardized assessments to determine the appropriate clinical intervention and level of care.  \n4)\tEvidence-based: The CCT will implement two evidence-based clinical interventions: MAT and RED.  \n\nThe proposed CCT has two Essential Roles\n1)\tThe care manager has expertise in OUDs and discharge planning. Responsibilities include assessment and engagement, care coordination, and post discharge follow up. \n2)\tThe addiction medicine specialist is a physician who holds a DEA X-waiver and/or board certification in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry. Responsibilities include clinical assessment, consultative recommendations, including support for utilization of evidence based medication, supervision of the CCT, and coordination with medical personnel.\n\nProcedures\n1)\tThe team will hold weekly meetings, document their clinical reports, assessments, and recommendations in the hospital electronic medical record (EMR) and communicate recommendations to the medical team directly, through the EMR, or in accordance with other hospital procedures for clinical communication. \n2)\tThe team will utilize standardized assessments, resources and tools. \n   a)\tProject Shout: https://www.projectshout.org/ \n   b)\tProject RED: https://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/systems/hospital/red/toolkit/index.html \n   c)\tCommunity Service Providers: CCT will utilize resource list with community service providers categorized by ASAM level of care, geographic region, insurance eligibility, and patient costs.\n   d)\tBrief Negotiated Interview: https://www.bu.edu/bniart/sbirt-in-health-care/sbirt-brief-negotiated-interview-bni/ and https://medicine.yale.edu/sbirt/opioidusedisorders.aspx\n   e)\tASAM Criteria: https://www.asam.org/resources/the-asam-criteria/about \n   f)\tASAM Standards of Care for the Addiction Specialist Physician https://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/publications/standards-of-care-final-design-document.pdf	48 to 59 months (9 months start up, 48 months from enrollment to completion of data analyses)	Approximately 4 months	\N	The University of New Mexico Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (UNM SDCC) housed in the Division of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Preventive Medicine (DEBPM) will provide the statistical analysis and reporting of the primary and secondary endpoint results. \n\nBaseline characteristics will be summarized with descriptive statistics such as, but not limited to, means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Analyses will be presented overall, by intervention arm, and by previous MAT use. Continuous baseline demographics and characteristics will be compared with t tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as appropriate. Categorical variables will be compared with chi-square or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Both primary endpoints will be compared between intervention arms by fitting a logistic regression model to each that includes as independent variables intervention arm, prior MAT use, and site, as well as covariates relevant baseline characteristics. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported for the primary outcomes that compare MAT and linkage services initiation rates in the two intervention arms. Similar analyses will be performed for the secondary outcomes. Investigators will be provided regular reports on enrollment overall and by site, and other process measures throughout the trial, but will blinded to the study primary and secondary outcomes until the final database is locked. All analyses will be performed in SAS 9.4 or higher, and R 3.2 or higher. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be finalized before the database is locked.	\N

The present investigation will review acute procedural, in-hospital, thirty-day, and last clinical evaluation outcomes for this patient population in preparation for a possible prospective trial.	This study will review patient charts from March 1, 2016 to February 28, 2018 for all patients who underwent TTVR (ViV or ViR) using Sapien 3 valve. Those who underwent TTVR using previous generation Sapien or Melody valve or are under 18 years of age will be excluded. A list of 19 U.S. centers accounting for 90 eligible patients was provided by the study sponsor and device vendor.  Some of the data will be embedded within the medical records and some of it cannot be auto populated. Hence, this will require manual review of charts and extraction of data. This will need to be done by individuals at each site. Budget allows us to pay a fixed amount for each patient's chart review. It will be up to the participating site who they want to assign for data collection RN, research coordinator, medical student, resident, fellow, attending. The data from each site will be uploaded using Penn State College of Medicine's REDCap platform as the data coordinating center. Penn State Heart and Vascular Institute will be responsible to supervise the overall conduct of the study, to retain the data from each participating center, to verify the data, to conduct the statistical analyses, and to prepare any reports, publications, or other information that will be disseminated. Data will be collected on patient demographics, morbidities, echocardiographic findings, procedural outcomes, symptom improvement, and major adverse clinical events through electronic medical records.

This project will use a two-site RCT to study known methods of reducing medication errors, especially by involving pharmacists. The goal of this project is to create new knowledge that makes it easier for more hospitals and health systems to use these methods, so that they can reduce harm caused by medication errors.

453	2019-01-28	55	\N	t	The Prospective Evaluation of Outcomes after ICD Generator Exchange (PRECEDE) study	PRECEDE Study	0	Multicenter, prospective cohort study: Prospective Evaluation of Outcomes after ICD Generator Exchange (PRECEDE).   Our primary hypothesis is that clinical variables can be identified which will facilitate patient-specific risk-benefit assessment at the time of ICD battery depletion and will guide decision-making regarding generator exchange that are amenable to investigation via randomized trials.	PRECEDE is a prospective, multicenter study designed to provide key data (patient characteristics, event rates in specific subgrous) of 800 patients undergoing ICD generator exchange at 10 sites, followed for 3 years. The data will be used to support the design of subsequent clinical trials of ICD generator replacement.  We believe the data collected in PRECEDE is a necessary step in planning randomized studies.	Specific Aim 1: To evaluate predictors of mortality and cause of death following ICD GE.  We will examine the utility of several different markers to predict mortality and cause of death following GE including history of ICD shocks, trend in LVEF, Seattle Heart Failure Model score and the Seattle Proportional Risk Model score.  \nSpecific Aim 2: To determine trajectories in health status and to assess the impact of ICD shocks on QoL after GE.  The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), a heart failure specific instrument, will be administered serially at 12 month intervals for 3 years after GE to assess trends in QoL across multiple domains.  Hypothesis 2: Health status will decrease most rapidly following GE among those at highest risk of non-cardiac death and among those who experience ICD shocks.  \nSpecific Aim 3: To assess patient perceptions about the decision to perform GE.  Little data exists on how patients weigh the relative risks and benefits of performing GE and whether patients view the decision to perform GE as distinct, or as a natural extension, from the decision to originally implant an ICD.  We will perform focused interviews and surveys in a sub-study of 100 patients to better understand the decision-making process.  Hypothesis 3: Younger patients, and those with a prior history of appropriate ICD shocks, will view the decision to perform ICD GE more favorably.

The four tobacco treatment components to be tested are: (1) Motivational Interviewing (MI) (Yes vs. No); (2) NRT Patch (Yes vs. No); 3) NRT Lozenge (Yes vs No); and 4) Message Framing (Gain vs Loss); Aim 2: To estimate the cost and incremental cost-effectiveness of evidence- based tobacco treatment components, delivered alone and in combination; Aim 3: Guided by well-established evaluation and conceptual implementation science frameworks, we will conduct a robust, mixed methods evaluation of the implementation process and assess factors that may influence implementation and sustainability for delivering and disseminating effective models for smoking cessation treatment in lung cancer screening settings	The primary outcome will be 7-day point-prevalence tobacco abstinence captured at the 6-month follow-up.\n\nSecondary cessation outcomes will be self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 3 months, continuous abstinence (between date of LDCT scan and date of completion of follow-up surveys)) at 3 and 6 months, self-reported 24hr quit attempts reported at 3 and 6 months.\n\nCost endpoints include average treatment costs, for each treatment component and for permutations of components, assessed from both the societal and provider perspectives. We will also estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness at 6 months of treatment components and their permutations.	1	Site Eligibility (as per SC self-report)\nMust be designated as an American College of Radiology (ACR) designated lung cancer screening site\nReports at least one year of lung cancer screening experience\nReports conducting at least 20 new initial screenings per month\n\nSite Coordinator (SC) Eligibility (as per SC self-report)\nEmployed at a participating lung cancer screening site \n\nPatient Eligibility (as per self-report)\nBetween the ages of 55-80 years old\nSeeking baseline or annual follow-up LDCT lung cancer screening \nHave at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking\nCurrently a smoker, defined as self-reported cigarette smoking (some days, every day) within the past 30 days.\nMust be reachable by telephone\nMust be English speaking due to the study materials being available in English only and limited available resources for translation. \n\nSubject Exclusion Criteria\n\nPatient (as per self-report)\nNRT is medically contraindicated (e.g., recent heart attack within the last 2 weeks or unstable/worsening angina). \nSmokers who are receiving other tobacco treatment services or have used cessation medications (NRT, bupropion, varenicline) within the past month.	There are 18 sites planned to participate in this study,each recruiting 64 patient participants. No none-US sites will be included.	NRT patches and/or lozenges will be provided to a porportion of patient participants per their random assignment.\n\nAll patients receiving loze ges will receive 6 cartons of 2mg lozenges.\n\nDosing off patches will be based on the number of cigarettes the patient smokes per day per self report:\n1. Patients who smoke less than 10 cigs/day will receive 4 wks of 14mg patches and 2 wks of 7mg patches;\n2. Patients smoking 10+ cigs/day will receive 2wks   each of the 21mg, 14mg and 7mg patches	Enrollment began in June 2018 (enrollment of site coordinators with patient enrollment beginning in August 2018. Sites will begin recruitment on a rolling basis through Q4 2019. Participants will be followed for approximately 6 months. We anticipate study completion to occur in Q4 2022.	Active participation per individual participant will last about 6-7 months, including follow up and bichemical verification of smoking abstinence at the end of the 6mo following.	This study is funded by an NCI grateful, RFA #15-011. There are no kknown investigator or institutional conflicts of interest.	\N	Recruitment of Sites and Site Coordinators: Staff from the LCA will coordinate recruitment and retention of participating LDCT sites for this study. Eligible sites will have at least one year of lung cancer screening experience, will have a full-time SC and will report conducting at least 20 initial screenings per month so as to have an adequate patient volume for feasible recruitment of current smokers during the allotted study timeframe. As stated earlier, this study will recruit and engage LDCT-LCS sites in staggered waves for a total of 18 sites. MSK staff will verbally consent the SCs at each of the sites - approximately 36 SCs will be enrolled. \n\nRecruitment of Smokers Seeking Lung Cancer Screening: We plan to recruit up to 64 smokers from each site to achieve target enrollment of 1,152 smokers. Smoking status will be ascertained by screening sites at the time of scheduling from all screening participants as required to confirm screening eligibility. All eligible current smokers will be identified by the SCs (or designee) who will introduce the study to all current smokers scheduled for a LDCT scan. Patients will provide their verbal permission to be contacted by MSK staff and SCs will provide current smokers' names and contact information to the MSK study staff member at the end of each workday. The SCs will also maintain a log of all patients who schedule a screening appointment noting the number of former and current smokers, if it is a baseline or follow-up screening appointment, the number of smokers who are ineligible and reasons for ineligibility, the number of refusers and their reasons for refusal, and demographic information (age, gender, race & ethnicity) of all current smokers which will be shared with MSK staff weekly. An MSK study staff will contact all smokers who agree to hear more about the study. Interested patients will be screened to confirm their eligibility, and if eligible, will provide verbal consent prior to their lung cancer screening visit, and complete the baseline survey either prior to their initial lung cancer screening visit, or within 1 week of the visit.    \n\nIn most cases, the initial contact with prospective participants will be conducted by the screening site team, investigator, or the research staff working in consultation with the treatment team. The recruitment process outlined above presents no more than minimal risk to the privacy of the patients who are screened and minimal PHI will be maintained as part of a screening log.\n\nWe began entollment at our first site in August 2018 and expect to roll out this project at the final site in Q4 2019, although sites will likely be onboarded on a rolling basis. We anticipate that it will take sites 6-9 months, in some cases longer, to recruit the expected 64 participants. On average each site completes approximately 20 scans per month and on average, approximately 50% their patients are current smokers.\n\nRecruitment efforts are essential to helping us meet our enrollment goals.

This proposal addresses two critical issues in an understudied population of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) at greatest risk for hospitalization and mortality - those with a recent hospitalization. These outcomes are important to patients, caregivers, clinicians, payers, health system administrators, investigators, and other stakeholders collaborating in this proposal.            We hypothesize that PR improves hospital-free survival at 1 year (primary outcome).	2,000 patients will be enrolled, within 4 weeks following hospital discharge for a COPD exacerbation, in a clinical efficacy trial using a parallel patient-level randomized design at 25 Clinical Centers.                 Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups: a) usual medical care (control condition) or b) usual medical care plus enhanced, PR (intervention).             Visits in person: Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months. Phone calls every 6 weeks in year one.      See Clinical Protocol Synopsis for outcome measures: hospitalization; mortality; activity; frailty; exercise tolerance; and patient reported outcomes (PRO): health-related quality of life, everyday activity level, dyspnea, participation in social activities, satisfaction with social roles and activities, sleep, fatigue, cognitive function, anxiety, and depression.	Primary aim (Aim 1). Compare the efficacy of enhanced, next generation pulmonary rehabilitation to usual medical care on hospitalization-free survival following a hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation. We will perform a randomized, controlled, clinical efficacy trial in 2,000 COPD patients.            Secondary aim (Aim 2). Compare the efficacy of enhanced PR to usual care in improving daily activity, frailty, exercise tolerance, patient reported outcomes (health-related quality of life, everyday activity level, dyspnea, participation in social activities, satisfaction with social roles and activities, sleep, fatigue, cognitive function, anxiety, and depressive symptoms), and reducing COPD exacerbations at one year.          Secondary aim (Aim 3). Determine patient characteristics that predict beneficial outcomes of enhanced PR, and develop a personalized approach to selection of patients most responsive to PR. This information will help apply personalized health care to patients with COPD, evaluate the potential for heterogeneity of treatment effects across different patient subgroups, and assist with subsequent dissemination and implementation.        Secondary aim (Aim 4). Estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and budgetary impact of enhanced PR for COPD patients following hospitalization compared to usual care at one year.	The primary outcome will be hospitalization-free survival at one year.	1	Inclusion criteria:     Physician diagnosis of COPD as primary lung disease.  Age >40 years.

We aim to (1) determine the pathogen genetic factors associated with the outcome, (2) Determine the host gene expression features associated with the outcome and (3) determine the pathogen gene expression factors associated with the outcome.	This is a prospective multi-center study with participants being consented and sampled at the University of Washington (lead site), Emory University, Oregon Health & Science University, Wills Eye Hospital (affiliated with Thomas Jefferson University) and the University of British Columbia in Canada.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Determine the pathogen genetic factors associated with the outcome. \nWe will prospectively collect intraocular biopsy samples from 150 patients diagnosed with post-surgical endophthalmitis. We will collect extensive clinical data at baseline, week 1, and month 1. We will perform whole-genome DNA sequencing (WGS) of the intraocular samples, identify and molecularly characterize the causative pathogen, and catalogue the strain variants that exist for each pathogen to determine whether these factors correlate with outcome. \n\nSpecific Aim 2: Determine the host gene expression features associated with the outcome. \nWe will perform RNA-seq in all collected endophthalmitis (n=180) and 30 control samples. Once RNA-seq is performed, human and non-human sequences will be separated and analyzed in Aim 2 and 3, respectively. We will characterize the host gene expression profile to determine whether these correlate with outcome. \n\nSpecific Aim 3: Determine the pathogen gene expression factors associated with the outcome. \nWe will analyze the non-human RNA sequences to test whether signature pathogen transcription profile correlates with clinical outcome.	Aim 1.1) Determine the correlation of visual acuity (VA) resolution at month 1 with the molecular species, relative abundance, and specific sequence variants. \nAim 1.2) Determine the correlation of month 1 VA resolution with the baseline presence and relative abundance of small DNA viruses. \nAim 1.3) Test whether the antibiotic resistance gene profile of the pathogen determined by WGS can predict the clinical outcome\n\nAim 2.1) Determine associations of the host gene expression profile with clinical outcome (=month 1 VA). \nAim 2.2) Establish the host gene expression profile associated with culture-positive and culture-negative endophthalmitis. \nAim 2.3.) Determine the effect of TTV on host gene expression. \n\nAim 3.1) Investigate the Staph epidermidis transcription profiles that are associated with better (month 1 VA >20/200) or worse visual outcome. \nAim 3.2) Determine the difference in DNA and RNA antibiotic resistance gene profile and correlate to clinical outcomes.	See objectives and statistical plan.	1	Inclusion criteria. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of post-surgical or post-procedural (i.e. intravitreal injection) endophthalmitis will be asked to participate in the study and informed consent will be obtained. Only patients with a history of surgery or intraocular procedure within 6 weeks of presentation will be included. There will be no bias for sex, race, or ethnic background for inclusion in the study.\n\nExclusion criteria. Participants will be excluded if less than 18 years old or not able to consent for the study. There will be no visual acuity criteria for inclusion in the study; however, patients whose presenting visual acuity is no light perception or those who have other ophthalmic conditions (i.e., macular ischemia, age-related macular degeneration, corneal scar, etc) that limit visual acuity to <20/200 will be excluded from the visual outcome analyses.\n\nInclusion criteria for control samples. Undiluted vitreous samples from pars plana vitrectomy for macular hole, epiretinal membrane, or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair. Both genders of age >18 will be recruited after an informed consent.

Years 1-3 will be dedicated to enrollment. Years 4-5 will be dedicated to analysis and publication. Enrollment may continue into year 4 if > 180 samples is desired and feasible.	Sampling will happen prospectively only. Clinical data will be collected at baseline, week 1, and month 1.	The investigator reports no financial ties or conflicts of interest for herself nor her team.	Aim 1.1) The correlation of visual acuity (VA) resolution at month 1 with the molecular species, the relative abundance, and their genome will be evaluated using ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis. \nAim 1.2) The correlation of month 1 VA resolution with the baseline presence and relative abundance of TTV and MCV will be evaluated with Wilcoxon rank sum and spearman rank correlation, respectively. \nAim 1.3) Assuming the laboratory tested antibiotic resistance profile as the gold standard, we will test the sensitivity and specificity of the antibiotic resistance genomic profile from WGS. We will also test whether particular antibiotic resistance genes are associated with worse clinical outcome (VA <20/200) with multivariate logistic regression.\n\nAim 2.1) We will determine the host gene expression profile associated with month 1 VA resolution. Aim 2.2) We will determine the host gene expression profile that distinguishes culture-positive from culture-negative endophthalmitis. Aim 2.3.) We will evaluate the effect of TTV in host gene expression profile by investigating whether certain host gene expression is associated with TTV. We will use global bootstrapped Monte Carlo rank order permutation testing to identify the significance of a combination of genes that may be associated with outcomes in Aim 2.1-2.3.\n\nAim 3.1) We will test whether Staph epi has signature transcription profiles that are associated with better (month 1 VA <20/200) or worse visual outcome.

Hypothesis: CBD will be effective in treating positive and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia.	This study is designed as a first proof of concept, Phase 2 study that will explore the antipsychotic potential of CBD in pediatric patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Patients will be stratified by symptom severity (per the positive and negative symptoms scale or PANSS) and randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: synthetic CBD 600 mg plus placebo, synthetic CBD 1200 mg plus placebo, or standard of treatment plus placebo. Patients satisfying the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated into one of the groups using a random number generation program. N, to be determined.	The primary objective is to demonstrate that CBD will be effective in treating positive and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia plus assessing dose effect. The secondary objective is to measure changes in physiological and affective condition, subjective state, safety (e.g. cardiometabolic, endocrine effects, and hormonal imbalance), and cognitive performance in addition to characterizing the pharmacokinetics of CBD and its active metabolite in plasma and urine. Results will serve as proof of concept and provide guidance for a larger Phase 3 clinical trial.

Furthermore, we intend to demonstrate this intervention is well-accepted by families, clinicians, and schools. The hypothesis of this study is that we can reduce asthma exacerbation risk by increasing adherence with daily controller medication in the schools.	We propose to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of ED-initiated School-Based Asthma Medication Supervision (ED-SAMS) among elementary-age children with mild-to-moderate asthma who are discharged from the ED following an asthma attack. Children will be randomized to ED-based ICS prescribing with home supervision or ED-initiated ICS dispensing with at-home and at-school supervision. All children will be treated with a standardized medication regimen consisting of once-daily budesonide inhalation powder (Pulmicort Flexhaler®) supplemented by as-needed albuterol sulfate (ProAir®).	Specific Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of dispensing inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department and supervising its use in the school setting.\nSpecific Aim 2:  Estimate a range of plausible intervention effect sizes to support the development of a larger multi-center clinical trial.\nSpecific Aim 3: Conduct a preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis.	Primary Endpoints: \n1) Evaluate our ability to recruit 90 participants within 6 calendar months, 2) Evaluate our ability to initiate supervised ICS use in the school setting within 5 business days, 3) Evaluate our ability to retain participants for the 90-day intervention period, and 4) Evaluate caregiver, school, and ED provider satisfaction with the ED-SAMS program.\n\nSecondary Endpoints: To estimate the confidence interval of the intervention's effect size and conduct a preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis.	2	Inclusion criteria are:\n•\tChildren 6-12 years of age; AND\n•\tTreated for an asthma as determined clinically by the principal ED provider based on symptoms such as shortness-of-breath, cough, and wheezing; AND\n•\tThe child's symptoms must improve following ≥1 doses of albuterol and ≥1 doses of systemic corticosteroids such that he/she can be safely discharged home; AND\n•\tThe child must have physician-diagnosed asthma as reported by parents or documented in the electronic medical record; AND\n•\tThe child must be a full-time student in a participating school.\n•\tThe child must speak English or Spanish; AND\n•\tChildren with or without a history of prior ICS use.\n\nExclusion criteria are:\n•\tChild does not provide assent; OR\n•\tChildren enrolled in another research study; OR\n•\tChildren are not discharged to home; OR\n•\tThe child's asthma is too severe to safely participate as evidenced by prior ICU admissions, ≥2 hospitalizations in past year, or NAEPP Step IV or higher care requiring ≥2 controller medications.	Enrollment will take place only from these three PECARN locations:\nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center\nMedical College of Wisconsin/Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (University of Wisconsin)\nChildren's National Health System (CNHS) (George Washington School of Medicine)\nEach site will be responsible for approximately 30 subjects each.\nThere will be no sites outside of the U.S.	Within the ED, care will be provided at the sole discretion of the primary ED provider including all tests, procedures, and treatments deemed appropriate to restore pulmonary function and safely discharge the participant home. At discharge, participants will receive either:\n\nED-prescribing (control): Participants will receive 3 prescriptions: (1) 40 mg of prednisolone once daily for 5 days or its equivalent, (2) 360 μg of budesonide inhalation powder (Pulmicort Flexhaler®) once daily for at home use, and (3) albuterol sulfate as needed for relief of acute respiratory symptoms.\n\nED-dispensing with home and school supervision (intervention): Participants will receive care as described above except instead of providing a prescription to participants they will be given a Pulmicort Flexhaler and albuterol inhaler for home use and an additional Pulmicort Flexhaler and albuterol inhaler will be couriered to the child's school health office within 3 business days of ED discharge. School health personnel will supervise the child's use of once-daily budesonide each school day. Parents will be instructed to supervise their child's at-home use only on weekends, holidays, and school absences.\nSubjects in the intervention arm will have observed medication use in the school with a once daily dose of 360mcg.	Approximately 9 months. We plan to begin enrollment in late August/Early September when the three schools open for the school year. The study enrollment will end in March/April to allow data collection for 90 days prior to school ending. Data analysis	The participant duration of the study will be from the time of the ED visit up to 90 days (3 months). We hope to have data analysis complete within 90 days as this is pilot data being gathered for a potentially much larger trial.	No conflicts.	Randomization of 90 patients allows estimation of consent and acceptance rates to within ± 6% (half-width of 95% confidence interval). With 45 subjects in each arm, we will be able to estimate recidivism to within approximately ± 15%.\nThe subjects for the proposed research children 6-12 years of age (grades K-5) who are treated for an asthma attack as determined clinically by the principal ED provider (e.g., shortness-of-breath, cough, wheezing that improves following ≥1 doses of albuterol or equivalent and ≥1 doses of systemic corticosteroids). The child's symptoms must resolve so that he/she can be safely discharged home. Children must have physician-diagnosed persistent asthma as reported by the child's parents and/or recorded in the HEDA's electronic medical record. Children must be enrolled full- time (5 days/week) in a participating school and must be 6-12 years of age with a physician diagnosis of asthma.  Parents must speak English or Spanish. We expect the children to be 40% female, 30% Hispanic, 54%     black and 45% white (30% are Hispanic White). \n \nWe expect children to be 40% female as is the national population of asthma among children; therefore, females will be adequately represented. We expect that approximately 84% of the children who enroll will be minorities: including approximately 54% black and 30% Hispanic. Therefore, minorities will be well represented in this research.\n\nAll resources required to implement school-based supervision will be measured including personnel time and medication courier fees. Asthma-related medical costs (e.g., ED visits) will be estimated using a gross-costing method where costs are bundled by service type (e.g. $600 per ED visit) rather than micro-costing where costs are individually aggregated (e.g. nursing time, medication, procedure costs at each ED visit). Gross-costing is more practical and reliable than micro-costing when a wide variety of service events and locations are being measured. Our primary source of cost data will come from medical record review to identify asthma-related ED visits; however, this will be supplemented by research logs (e.g. intervention-related personnel time and courier fees) and parent interviews (e.g., prescription fills for ICS albuterol among the control group). Where possible or needed these data will be crosschecked against existing estimates from secondary sources such as the published literature.	To ensure random selection of participants, each ED will screen patients during pre-specified windows scheduled by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). In order to avoid enrollment bias, the DCC biostatistician will create a randomized screening schedule for each site based on the availability of research staff and local census patterns. The screening schedule will also set monthly enrollment targets to achieve the recruitment goal.\n\nResearch staff will approach parents of children who are being treated for symptoms consistent with an asthma attack. The research staff will explain the study and will provide parents with a brief written description. Written consent will be obtained from parents; verbal assent will be obtained from children. To avoid interfering with clinical care, recruitment and study procedures will occur when the patient is not actively engaged in treatment (e.g. waiting for testing to commence and/or results to return). Given a 6-hour turn- around between presentation and discharge  within PECARN EDs, we anticipate adequate time will be available to identify, recruit, and evaluate study participants. To ensure all participants can complete 90 days of school-supervised treatment before summer break, recruitment will commence in August-September (school start) and will cease February-March (90 days prior to school end).\n\nTo achieve our 90 participant goal, each site will be expected to enroll 8 participants per month over a 4-month window. If needed, recruitment can continue for two additional months.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden in pediatric ECMO is exceptionally high, with\naverage transfusion volumes of up to 40 ml/kg/day, or approximately half a child's entire\ncirculating blood volume for each day on ECMO. There is no evidence that liberal\nRBC transfusion strategies on ECMO are helpful, and they may be harmful. In our recent multicenter\nobservational study of over 500 infants and children on ECMO (and work of others) higher\nRBC transfusion volume was independently associated with higher odds of mortality. Given the\nhigh transfusion burden and potential associated harm, an interventional trial is urgently needed\nto evaluate RBC transfusion thresholds and drive evidence-based transfusion decisions. Our\nultimate goal is to reduce unnecessary transfusions and improve outcomes in this highly\nvulnerable population.	Participating sites for the pilot trial will include 4 active PALISI sites, 3 of whom are also CPPCRN\nmembers (Nationwide Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Children's National\nMedical Center, and Washington University/St. Louis Children's). Potential subjects will be identified by daily screening of the intensive care unit census. Informed consent will be obtained by parents/legal guardians within 48 hours of ECMO initiation. Children over the age of 9 who are not receiving sedative medications will provide assent per local\nInstitutional Review Board policy. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive a red blood cell transfusion if the hemoglobin falls below 10 g/dL (liberal strategy) versus 8 g/dL (restrictive strategy) in a 1:1 ratio. Randomized\nblocks of varying length will be used to create a randomization schedule that is stratified by\nsubgroup: 1) cardiac primary diagnosis; 2) non-cardiac-primary diagnosis on VA ECMO; 3) noncardiac\nprimary diagnosis on VV ECMO.	The overall objective of the HEROES pilot trial is to provide necessary and sufficient information\nto proceed to a definitive, multi-network, multi-center randomized clinical trial to evaluate liberal\nversus restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds in pediatric ECMO. Additionally, we expect to\nprovide a roadmap for future, innovative interventional trials in pediatric ECMO. As one of the first\nmulti-center interventional trials in this population, we anticipate that the HEROES research\nprogram will represent a paradigm-shifting approach to evidence-based medicine in pediatric\nECMO.	Primary Outcome Measure:\nProportion of RBC transfusions given according to randomly assigned treatment arm or in\nresponse to a priori approved reasons for protocol suspension\n- Local study staff will screen daily for any red blood cell transfusion(s) which is\ngiven either without a prior hemoglobin measure or after a hemoglobin measure\nwhich is higher than the assigned threshold. For each instance, the local study\nstaff will determine whether criteria were met for protocol suspension (for life\nthreatening hemorrhage, for persistent shock, or to facilitate wean from ECMO). If\ncriteria were not met, the RBC transfusion will be documented as protocol noncompliant.\nStudy staff will be asked to record the indication for the non-compliant\nRBC transfusion as provided by the primary attending physician.\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Number of other protocol deviations/violations and reasons for deviations/violations\n- Number of protocol-compliant protocol suspensions and reasons for suspensions\n- Proportion of missing data elements\n- Rates of guideline adherence and reasons for guideline non-adherence\n- Laboratory-based hemoglobin values with concurrent point of care measures in order to\ndetermine concordance between values to consider use of point of care measures in the\ndefinitive trial\n- RBC transfusion volume per interventional arm	2	Inclusion Criteria\n- Admission to a participating center\n- Treatment with VA or VV ECMO\nExclusion Criteria\n- ECMO initiation greater than 48 hours prior to enrollment\n- Age > 18 years at the time of enrollment\n- Conscientious objection or unwillingness to receive blood products\n- Post-conception age < 37 weeks at the time of enrollment\n- Primary diagnosis of meconium aspiration syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, or\npersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn\n- Pre-transplant status (listed for transplantation) at the time of enrollment or bridge to\ntransplant as indication for ECMO\n- Plan in place at the time of enrollment for transition to ventricular assist device (VAD)\n- Undergoing brain death evaluation or likely progression to brain death as determined by\nthe primary treatment team\n- Oncology diagnosis or status post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n- Diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy\n- Congenital heart disease with cyanotic physiology\n- Defined as congenital heart disease with goal O2 saturation < 85% at the time of\nECMO initiation.	Participating sites for the pilot trial will include 4 active PALISI sites, 3 of whom are also CPPCRN\nmembers (Nationwide Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Children's National\nMedical Center, and Washington University/St. Louis Children's). No other sites will participate.	Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive a red blood cell transfusion if the hemoglobin falls\nbelow 10 g/dL (liberal strategy) verses 8 g/dL (restrictive strategy) in a 1:1 ratio. Randomized\nblocks of varying length will be used to create a randomization schedule that is stratified by\nsubgroup: 1) cardiac primary diagnosis; 2) non-cardiac-primary diagnosis on VA ECMO; 3) noncardiac\nprimary diagnosis on VV ECMO. Practitioners will not be blinded to interventional arm because they will need to know the\nhemoglobin values for enrolled patients in order to adequately care for them. Because study PIs\nand site PIs may also care for ECMO patients within their own institutions, it is also not possible to\nblind local study staff to interventional arm. However, all study staff, including study PIs, clinical\ncoordinators, and site PIs will remain blinded to multi-center outcomes per interventional group\nthroughout the conduct of the pilot trial. Study statisticians will be blinded to interventional arms\nthroughout the conduct of the pilot trial, including the data analysis phase. Additionally, subject\nhemoglobin/hematocrit values, which would un-blind the interventional arms, will be censored\nfrom the data until primary analyses are complete.	24 months	The protocol will end at the time of ECMO decannulation or at 28 days of\nenrollment, whichever occurs first.

76	2016-12-07	100	\N	\N	Building capacity to deliver effective obesity management interventions within primary care settings	Obesity Management Study	\N	The overall goal of this one year pilot project is to initiate a collaborative research effort between CTSC sites to examine how teleconferencing technology can expand access to, coordinate, and improve the quality of youth obesity health care services, especially those which may also serve the broader community and rural areas.  Specifically, we will examine the degree to which a promising treatment model for obesity, Mindful Eating (ME) can be effectively standardized and taught via video teleconferencing to health providers currently working with pediatric obesity populations in their clinics, increasing access to training resources and establishing a foundation for future studies examining patient outcomes. We hypothesize that given each institutions' unique diversity related to both the types of programs and settings that provide youth obesity management, this study will provide unique information on how best to integrate a clinical intervention within diverse clinical settings.  In addition, identification and integration of a telehealth infrastructure provides a viable platform to disseminate training curriculums for health providers that can extend beyond mindful eating and can be utilized for various trainings related to youth obesity management.	All consent procedures, assessments, and training will be conducted via the internet.  Each healthcare provider participant will be asked to fill out demographics questionnaire, a pre-post training knowledge questionnaire, and a 3-month follow-up survey.  The demographic questionnaire will include the following provider information: discipline, years in practice, percentage of time spent working in a pediatric obesity management clinic(s), number of youth seen each year, and percentage of youth who are seen multiple times throughout the year for weight management.  In addition, each provider will be asked about prior mindfulness and ME training and to identify any ME domains, themes and/or practices that are currently part of the standard of care implemented within the pediatric weight management programs at their respective institution.  Interest level in acquiring standardized ME skills will also be obtained.      The pre-post online training survey will be filled out within the 2 weeks prior to training and within 2 weeks post training.  This survey will assess knowledge, awareness, and attitudes regarding the use of ME skills with pediatric populations.  For the knowledge component, we will determine a pass rate of at least 80% on the concepts within and behind ME to be indicative of adequate learning.  In order to facilitate learning of the material, any provider who falls below the 80% pass rate will be asked to view any relevant training sessions again, consult the training manual, discuss concepts with trainer Dr. Dalen, and retake the knowledge questionnaire.     Providers will be asked to attend 6-1� hour live telehealth group sessions to provide a platform from which providers can explore and practice core aspects of ME.  Each telehealth session will be videotaped for future access and viewing in case a provider has to miss a live session due to scheduling constraints. Before the end of each training session, providers will be asked to answer a few brief evaluation questions to ascertain provider's subjective competency levels, self-efficacy (i.e., confidence) for teaching ME, benefits of learning that session's ME content, and effectiveness of training method after each training session.    After training, heath providers will then complete a three month post-training evaluation on their subjective use of ME with overweight and obese youth in their clinics that examines: a) their perceived ability to integrate ME skills with their patients (i.e. how often and with how many patients), b) perceived barriers/facilitators to teaching ME, and c) perceived patient acceptance of learning ME skills.    All questionnaires are in the development phase and will be submitted for approval once developed.	Aim 1.A. Test the effectiveness of a 6-week mindful eating (ME) training curriculum delivered via telehealth for healthcare provider use with pediatric obesity and weight management populations. The curriculum will be tailored to the education needs of pediatric healthcare providers, suitable for use in applied community settings, and demonstrate feasibility and acceptability. Hypothesis: participants will be able to pass a knowledge test evaluating their grasp of the concepts within and behind ME with a pass rate of at least 80% to essential therapeutic elements. Program will show acceptability by participants attending at least 80% of the training sessions.        Aim1.B. Secondary exploratory analyses includes (a) differences in knowledge change score by region, and (b) differences in     knowledge change score by type of provider.  In addition, participant feedback will be assessed through weekly evaluation forms     ascertaining subjective competency levels, self-efficacy for teaching ME, benefits of learning ME, and effectiveness of training     method after each training session.  All provider feedback will be gathered and outcomes related to competency and adherence     will be evaluated.  Any deficits will be addressed through program and training refinement and the manual will be revised     accordingly.    Aim 2: To assess ME curriculum use and integration within the healthcare provider's primary care setting.  Specifically, participants will complete a three month post-training evaluation on their use of ME with overweight and obese youth in their clinics that examines: a) their perceived ability to integrate ME skills with their patients (i.e. how often and with how many patients), b) perceived barriers/facilitators to teaching ME, and c) perceived patient acceptance of learning ME skills.	There will be three primary outcomes examined that will determine project success.    Outcome 1:  The primary outcome to be measured is the feasibility and acceptability of the training for providers.  Acceptability will be determined by providers attending at least 80% of the training sessions.  Feasibility will be determined by providers completing a ME knowledge questionnaire with a pass rate of at least 80% on the concepts within and behind ME to be indicative of adequate learning.    Outcome 2:  Participant acceptability will also be assessed through weekly evaluation forms ascertaining subjective competency levels, self-efficacy for teaching ME, benefits of learning ME, and effectiveness of training method after each training session.  This feedback with assist with evaluation of participant competency and adherence to the training which will allow for training refinement and revision of the manual.    Outcome 3: A three month post-training evaluation will be conducted on healthcare provider use of ME with overweight and obese youth in their clinics that examines: a) their perceived ability to integrate ME skills with their patients (i.e. how often and with how many patients), b) perceived barriers/facilitators to teaching ME, and c) perceived patient acceptance of learning ME skills.  We anticipate a completion rate of at least 80% of the participants.	2	Inclusion Criteria: Employed as a health provider at the institution as either a Physician, Physician Assistant, Nurse Practitioner, Nurse, Health Educator, and/or Registered Dietician; Currently working with pediatric youth ages 11-18 with obesity and weight management; ability to participate in both assessment and training activities; and English speaking.    Exclusion criteria: providers who are unable to attend the majority of the live trainings (4) and do not have time in their schedule to participate; non-English speaking.	Not provided.	Mindful Eating Training. Providers will be asked to attend 6-1� hour live telehealth group sessions to provide a platform from which providers can explore and practice core aspects of ME.  Each telehealth session will be videotaped for future access and viewing in case a provider has to miss a live session due to scheduling constraints. Each session is designed to be highly interactive and experiential and will consist of both didactic information and ME-awareness exercises that can be directly taught to youth. Content will consist of core components of professional ME training curricula adapted for use with healthcare providers, who may not have been previously exposed to the concepts of mindfulness.  Standardized handouts and materials that can be printed out and used with youth in a primary care setting will be included.  Approximately two hours of homework will be given each week, which will typically consist of reading the training manual, and practicing mindful eating awareness techniques for themselves.  Before the end of each training session, providers will be asked to answer a few brief evaluation questions to ascertain provider's subjective competency levels, self-efficacy (i.e., confidence) for teaching ME, benefits of learning that session's ME content, and effectiveness of training method after each training session.	Not provided.	Not provided.	Not applicable.	Collected data will be descriptive in nature. All provider feedback will be gathered and outcomes related to competency and adherence will be evaluated and interpreted.  Any deficits will be addressed through program and training refinement and the manual will be revised accordingly.  The newly revised training manual will be used for future research projects. CTSC Biostatisticians will assist with data analysis.    Sample Size Justification. 80 healthcare providers will be recruited. Sample size considerations are based on optimal positioning for future larger multisite studies and based on the following assumptions: 1) ability to develop a power analysis based on AIM 2 feasibility outcome; healthcare provider knowledge test with a pass rate of at least 80% on essential therapeutic elements. Analysis goal will be to determine with at least 0.90 power utilizing a T-test to determine the change score necessary to detect adequate power for a future study (see table 1 in appendex); 2) a larger sample will allow for secondary exploratory analyses utilizing ANOVA at a power of at least 0.80 to examine (a) differences in knowledge change score by region, and (b) differences in knowledge change score by type of provider (see table 2 in appendex); and (c) allows for attrition between and within sites; we estimate that a sample size between 50-80 will be sufficient for pilot study goals.	Each site will identify the key primary care clinics and multidisciplinary healthcare providers at their respective institutions who will participate in the training (both rural and urban) based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Once identified, those participants will be given information about the study and invited to participate.  A flyer and brochure will be developed that sites can give to interested participants.  All participants will be sent a link to an on-line consent form once they have agreed to participate.  A site-specific designated research assistant (RA) contact as well as the site lead PI contact trained in IRB consent procedures will be listed so participants can contact if they have any questions about the study.  Informed consent will be obtained from each participant prior to the start of the procedures. The on-line consent form will be constructed from the same template as a paper copy and will describe the research study in detail. Each step of the data collection process will be explained, as well as risks and benefits of participation. All other relevant information, such as confidentiality of videotapes and assessments, voluntary nature of participation, etc. will be explained, and participants will have the opportunity to contact research staff to answer any questions before signing. Participants will be told that participation is 100% voluntary and that by signing the consent/assent form they are not waiving their rights to terminate participation at any time during the study if they so choose.    Signed consent will consist of an electronic signature and the participant hitting an 'I agree' button.  The consent form will be set up in Redcap and will be directly imported into a password protected database.  RA's will print out the signed consent form and keep the hard copy in a location separate from the data. There will be no links between the consent form with identifiable information and the survey database.      Once potential participants are identified and agree to hear more information about the study, an RA will send out a link to a secure site where they are walked through the essential elements of informed consent. Participants will only get this link by first phoning an RA to go through a screening interview to determine eligibility. The RA will email or text them the link to consent for the study.    Projected Timelines. 1) Enrollment of participants will take place in study months 1-5; 2) Mindful eating training for participants will take place in study months 5-8, and 3) Post-Training Evaluation to be completed by participants in study months 11-12. The amount of time it will take for each health provider's participation is as follows: (1) Attendance at the 6 � hours of online trainings, which will also include 2 hours of individual homework following each training, (2) Completion of an on-line assessment battery consisting of a demographics questionnaire, a pre and post training questionnaire estimated to take approximately 1 hour each, and a 1 hour 3 month follow-up questionnaire.
283	\N	2	\N	\N	Multi-center randomized controlled trial of aggressive vs. conservative early fluid resuscitation for acute pancreatitis	Fluid resuscitation for acute pancreatitis	6	Aggressive early fluid resuscitation is universally recommended by current clinical practice guidelines. However, evidence supporting such an approach is limited. We hypothesize that aggressive early hydration will reduce the incidence of complications in acute pancreatitis and to test this we are proposing a prospective multi-center randomized controlled trial of aggressive vs. conservative early fluid resuscitation.	Multi-center prospective, parallel-group, double-blind randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of early fluid resuscitation on clinical outcomes in patients with acute pancreatitis.	Specific Aim 1. Compare the safety and efficacy of aggressive versus conservative approaches to early fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis.  \n\nSpecific Aim 2. Validate clinical outcome assessment (COA) measures in acute pancreatitis.  \n\nSpecific Aim 3. Prospectively measure patient reported outcome and morbidity following an episode of acute pancreatitis.  \n\nSpecific Aim 4. Establish a bio-specimen repository for future bio-marker and genetic analysis of systemic inflammation in acute pancreatitis.	Primary clinical endpoint \nThe primary efficacy outcome will be a composite outcome of systemic complications defined as persistent (>=48 hours) organ failure, local complications (parenchymal or extra-pancreatic necrosis, walled-off necrosis and/or symptomatic pancreatic fluid collection), extra-pancreatic infection, and/or in-hospital death.  The primary safety outcome will be incidence of hypotension, acute respiratory failure, oliguria or additional serious adverse event requiring discontinuation of study protocol.\n\nSecondary endpoints\nSecondary outcomes will include the following:\n-\tPancreatitis activity score at 48- and 72 hours\n-\tCRP and IL-6 levels at 48- and 72 hours\n-\tTime-to-successful resumption of oral intake\n-\tLength of hospitalization	1	Inclusion criteria\n•\tAge≥18 years\n•\tAcute pancreatitis defined by 2 of 3 following criteria\no\tUpper abdominal pain\no\tSerum amylase/lipase >3x upper limit of normal\no\tFeatures of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional imaging\n•\tEnrollment within 12 hours from initial hospital presentation\n\n\nExclusion criteria\n•\tNew York Heart Association Class II or greater heart failure\n•\tPreviously diagnosed liver cirrhosis\n•\tChronic kidney disease stage II or greater\n•\tChronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring home oxygen therapy\n•\tActive evidence myocardial ischemia\n•\tSepsis with mean arterial pressure<=60 mmHg at enrollment\n•\tHypercalcemia (serum Calcium >13 mg/dL)\n•\tCalcific chronic pancreatitis\n•\tPancreatic cancer\n•\tPatient's that have received >3L intravenous fluid prior to study enrollment	The stus is planned to be conducted at around 20 centers within United States.	Aggressive resuscitation protocol: participants assigned to the aggressive resuscitation protocol will receive an initial intravenous fluid bolus of 20 ml/kg followed by 3 ml/kg/hr.  Participants with evidence of tachycardia (pulse>90 beats/min) or fever (temperature>38C) after 12 +/- 6 hours of resuscitation will receive an additional intravenous fluid bolus of 20 ml/kg. \n\nConservative resuscitation protocol: participants will receive an initial intravenous fluid bolus of 10 ml/kg followed by continuous infusion of 1.5 mL/kg/hr.  Participants that have already received >1 L of fluid prior randomization will not receive additional bolus fluid but be placed on maintenance fluid at a rate of 1.5 mL/kg/hr.  Participants with evidence of tachycardia (pulse>90 beats/min) or fever (temperature>38C) after 12 +/- 6 hours of resuscitation will receive an additional intravenous fluid bolus of 10 ml/kg.	No estimate available yet.	Study staff will perform daily assessment of individual study participants for the duration of their hospital stay to assess study outcome parameters as well as for adverse events/serious adverse events.  Blood collection will be performed on days 1, 2, 3 and day 7. Follow-up telephone contact will be made 30-days, 3-, 6- and 12 months post-discharge to assess for residual symptoms as well as any re-hospitalization.	None.	\N	\N

302	54	f	180	To demonstrate feasibility of enrollment and identify the route of administration to be used in the subsequent RCT, we plan to administer GM-CSF to a minimum of 20 subjects (10 per group, IV vs SQ). Given that immunoparalysis is present in approximately one third of children with MODS studied to date, we anticipate needing to enroll a minimum of 180 children with MODS in the GRACE study.  All patients admitted to the PICU and CTICU at participating sites will be evaluated for study eligibility.	8	0	\N	1

90	47	f	370	A total of 370 males and females who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized into the study. As this study seeks to enroll relatively healthy participants with moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder, recruitment and retention will be a challenge throughout the study. It is not uncommon for this population to experience several barriers to initiating and being retained in study activities including, but not limited to unstable living arrangements, irregular schedules, legal problems, unreliable transportation, and financial insecurity. Men use methamphetamine more than women do. Thus, oversampling women to support analysis of treatment effects by gender also will be challenging. This multi-site study will be conducted at a variety of institutions in seven cities across six states. Each study site will have recruitment challenges specific to their unique set of variables.	7	\N	\N	\N

Overall, during the next 4 years we would expect at least 32,500 visits for children with a fracture. Overall enrollment and completed follow-up of eligible visits will provide 14,000 children for analysis.\n\nThese injuries have a slight predilection for males at a rate of 60% but both male and female children are eligible.\n\nThe parents of generally health children will be recruited. If the child has any other injuries or developmental/cognitive delays that make it impossible to report outcomes of interest, the parent/guardian is not eligible. \n\nStrategically selected sites within PECARN will enroll patients including: Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (Chicago, IL), Children's Hospital Colorado (Denver, CO), The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA), Children's National Medical Center (Washington DC), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH), and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI). One of the key strengths of this proposed study is the diverse population of children that is captured, and the well-developed infrastructure of PECARN, within which we can successfully meet our research aims. The participating EDs represent a variety of geographic settings and ethnicities across the United States. These sites have successfully participated in multiple research projects in the past through PECARN. These features of the study population/setting support the feasibility of study completion and will enable us to generalize our findings.	6	0	\N	6
386	37	t	400	The study population will be individuals of any age or gender with any inherited disorder associated with hyperphenylalaninemia. These include phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency (phenylketonuria or PKU), disorders of biopterin synthesis (GTP cyclohydrolase 1 or 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency, disorders of biopterin recycling (dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) or Pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) deficiencies), or DNAJC12 deficiency. We plan to recruit at least 100 subjects with PAH deficiency in each of four age groups: < 6 years age, 6-11 years, 12-17 years, > 17 years.  The other disorders are much more rare and we do not yet have a specific recruitment target.	6	0	\N	6
387	173	f	1000	Although the specifics are TBD, based on info gathered in Parts I and II, we anticipate that the study subjects will be all adult patients with appointments to attend designated primary care clinics in sites selected to participate in the trial.  Inclusion of children would be difficult because of the need for parents to have care seats that would have to be installed for each shared ride, and then carried around with them during clinic visits.	3	0	\N	2
46	27	f	360	We will enroll adults 40-75 years of age, the age of most individuals with type 2 diabetes or pre diabetes. Subjects with diabetes will be only on diet therapy or oral agents that are non-hypoglycemic (i.e. no sulfonylrueas or glenides). This will limit the chances of hypoglycemia if, as hypothesized, they become more insulin sensitive with iron reduction.	3	\N	\N	\N
54	39	f	600	The target population will be persons with prodromal Alzheimer's dementia, overweight or obese, without known diabetes that requires treatment. Prodromal Alzheimer's dementia will be defined as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (AMCI), using the Peterson criteria, and pre-AMCI (also known as early AMCI), defined by memory test cutoff of 1 standard deviation instead of the typical 1.5 standard deviation used in the Peterson criteria. We do not propose biomarker evidence of AD for inclusion into the study. Overweight or obese will be defined by a body mass index (BMI) ? 25 m/k2  . Persons with known diabetes will be excluded because they are already on metformin or other diabetes medications. However, persons with newly discovered diabetes with a HbA1c of less than 7% will be considered for inclusion with agreement from their physicians if they are deemed not to require pharmacologic treatment.	10	\N	\N	\N
435	19	f	815	The study is powered to the primary efficacy analysis. Using internal pilot data and systematic review, we assume an equal CD-TLR rate to be approximately 30% at 12 months. With a given non-inferiority margin (δ) of 10% and an attrition rate of 15%, a total sample of 816 subjects (i.e., 544 in the non-stent arm and 277 in the stent arm) will be required to provide a power of 80% and one-sided significance level of 2.5% to demonstrate non-inferiority of non-stent to stent-based treatment. If the non-inferiority of non-stent is met, a superiority testing will be performed with a one-sided significance level of 2.5%. Using a one-sided significance level of 2.5%, the study will have approximately 80% power to demonstrate superiority with a difference of 8.98% of non-stent to stent. All participants will be recruited in the U.S. and at least 30% women and minorities will be enrolled. These projections are based on the the current enrollment data from the XLPAD registry. The ongoing U.S. core laboratory adjudicated REDCap-based peripheral intervention XLPAD registry will be be used as the framework for this registry randomized clinical trial.	20	0	\N	5

Data from 2016 through the start date of the project will be utilized as baseline data. Data will continue to be tracked through the two-year project. There are approximately 2,000 children with SCD who are part of the PECARN Registry in any given year. Of these patients, there are approximately 2,600 visits to the ED per year by 1,200 children for acute painful VOC. For Aim 2, A mix of observing, discussing, and walking the process will be used. For all aspects of this study, all seven sites currently in the Registry project will be included: Lurie Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati), Nationwide Children's Hospital,\nChildren's Hospital of Colorado,Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,Children's National Medical Center\n \nResearch coordinators (RCs) will observe clinicians engaged in taking care of patients from the time of ED arrival through ED disposition to identify any barriers to timely treatment of acute pain, using the established process map as a guideline to the process. This task is meant to be done as observation only with minimal distractions to the clinicians. Notes will be taken by the RC regarding work arounds or skips in different steps in the guideline. After the observation, the RC will complete the BIM to document their findings. RCs will also discuss the barriers and facilitators with ED providers at each site using the BIM as a tool to guideline adherence. Lastly, we will ask an ED provider at each site to note any barriers or facilitators to providing this care in the ED setting as they walk through the process in real time clinical care. RCs will also survey five patient/parent pairs at each site at the end of an ED visit for SCD pain to determine their perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to guideline adherent ED care from the patient perspective. The RCs will also interview families with children hospitalized to discuss barriers and facilitators to the use of hydroxyurea.	8	0	\N	7
360	29	f	200	Sample size and power calculations were performed for the primary endpoint using estimates from available published data. We estimate that at one year from study entry, 15% of patients with LGD would progress to neoplasia in the endoscopic surveillance arm compared to 2% in the EET arm. Using this assumption and accounting for an attrition rate of 15%, we estimate that a total of 200 patients (100 per study arm) would provide a statistical power of at least 80% to detect the hypothesized difference in the primary outcome between the groups. The investigators are prepared to increase this number based on results of the Engagement and planning phase including a pilot study that will address patient willingness to participate and undergo randomization.	19	0	\N	10

456	168	f	118	A convenience sample of adults with PMS will be recruited from the study sites. The multi-site design of the trial is intended to promote generalizability of the study results.The sample size and power analysis were based on the pilot LA in SPMS trial in which LA had improved time to complete the T25FW (-0.54 seconds SD 0.36 vs 0.14 SD 0.25, p = 0.06). A sample size of 44 per group will have 80% power to detect a difference between the LA group with a coefficient, β1 regression slope of -0.50 seconds and the placebo group coefficient, β2 slope of -1.00, assuming that the standard deviation of the difference between the groups is 2.20 and the standard deviation of the residuals (repeated measures within each participant) is 1.80 with a 0.05 two-sided significance level and the correlation of 0.85 between the measurements over time, which if lower increases the power. A sample size of 59 per arm will allow for a 25% drop-out rate. No special efforts will be undertaken to recruit specific sub-populations. Specifically, MS, like other autoimmune diseases, has a predilection for affecting women in a 3-4:1 ratio. Therefore we expect women to be adequately\nrepresented in this current study using a convenience sample. Minorities will not be preferentially recruited as there is no data to suggest a differential effect of LA on specific minority populations and/or with particular genetic characteristics.\nMS is rare in children, and progressive forms of MS rare within this small population. Therefore no children will be enrolled.\nThe pilot LA trial recruited 21 Veterans of the total 51 from VA Portland Health Care System which serves 2-300 Veterans with MS. The current proposed study has more restrictive inclusion criteria than the pilot study, requiring that subjects\nare ambulatory. Recruitment of non-Veterans and use of multiple VA and non-VA study sites is necessary to fulfill the enrollment	9	1	Canada - recently added, we understand if you cannot consult related to international site recruitment	3

This effort will be led by the UCI Pediatric Exercise and Genomics Research Center (PERC) biostatistician Annamarie Stehli. Reproducibility analyses will be conducted within each cohort evaluating the CPET and MBEB variables in year 1. Power analyses (based on existing PERC data) conducted using G*power (167) indicate that for the repeated measures analyses within each cohort and across site, 34 participants are required per use-group for effect size of f=0.25 at 80% power. Based on coinvestigator Dr. Robert Liem's data (2), 40 sickle cell anemia participants per group in this study will yield 80% power to detect effect sizes as small as d= 0.55 (moderate) and greater than 95% power to detect differences larger than d=0.75.  Similarly, having twenty participants per cohort at each site will yield the same power to detect moderate and large effect sizes, respectively, including an interaction effect.         vRECRUITMENT PLAN    Both the UCI and Northwestern CTSAs are affiliated with major stand-alone children's hospitals [Children's Hospital of Orange County, Miller Children's Hospital (Long Beach, CA) and The Anne and Robert Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago]. Recruitment of children with sickle cell anemia and cancer survivors will be accomplished by working with the respective hematology and oncology centers at each site. Healthy children will be recruited through local schools, community and religious organizations, health fairs, and advertisements.	3	\N	\N	\N

The study population will be adults aged 18 - 65 years old newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed currently on no treatment, with definite or probable neurosarcoidosis, as established by previous criteria.  Any gender or ethnicity patient will be eligible.  Pregnant patients will be excluded.  The patients must be able to safely undergo clinical neurologic examination, MRI scan of appropriate area of the nervous system, or spinal fluid examination, as dictated by clinical circumstances.  \nPatients must diagnosed with nervous system neurosarcoidosis of the brain or spine including chronic meningitis, hydrocephalus,  hypothalamic syndrome, optic neuritis, cranial nerve palsy, focal cerebral disease, focal brainstem disease, cerebellar syndrome, myelopathy, polyradiculopathy, or cauda equina syndrome will be included.  Patients with only peripheral nerve or muscle involvement will be excluded.  \nA sample size of 100 patients will be the target.  Patients will come from a geographically diverse location, defined by the site of the institution enrolling the patient.

290	51	f	1800	During Phase 1, stakeholders will participate in the development of PROMPT-ED. Up to 5 patients (with their parents) will be recruited to participate in a collaborative design team. Up to 20 additional patients will conduct usability testing on the patient portal, and up to 20 more patients will conduct usability testing on the tailored discharge instructions. In all cases, participants will be aged 8-17, and efforts will be made to recruit participants who are diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender. \nDuring the development of PROMPT-ED (Phase 1), up to 4 clinicians will also participate in the collaborative design team. Up to 30 additional clinicians will be recruited to contribute to PROMPT-ED development via usability testing or participation in system "walk throughs." Patients and clinicians participating in the elements of Phase 1 described above will only be recruited from the Cincinnati and Washington DC sites. However, clinicians from all sites may contribute input on some elements of PROMPT-ED via survey.\nFor the quasi-experimental trial (Phase 2), approximately 1600 8-17 year old patients of varying gender, race, and ethnicity will be recruited from 4 EDs in Cincinnati, OH, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, PA, and Denver, CO. All 4 sites serve diverse patient populations. Two sites (Washington, D.C. and Denver) serve populations that are 5-20% Spanish-speaking, and will enroll Spanish-speaking participants. The other sites serve populations that are under 3% Spanish speaking, and will enroll only English-speaking patients. All participants will have sustained an mTBI within the previous 24 hours.\nAll clinicians at all study sites will be invited to complete the pre-implementation satisfaction survey. All clinicians who complete at least 3 evaluations of patients using PROMPT-ED will be invited to take the survey assessing PROMPT-ED acceptability.	4	0	\N	4

385	18	f	450	Eligibility criteria will include 1) self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, 2) age between 18 and 70 years, 3) receive primary care at one of the participating clinical sites, 4) at least one office visit within the previous 12 months to the primary care site, 5) diagnosis of T2D in the medical record, 6) T2D diagnosis for six months or longer, 7) most recent hemoglobin A1c≥8%, and 8) intention to continue to receive medical care at the recruitment clinic for the next six months.  The value of 8% is higher than the goals established by the American Diabetes Association Guidelines (hemoglobin A1c<7%)98, but lower than the definition of poorly controlled T2D established by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Core Quality Measures Collaborative (hemoglobin A1c>9%)99.  It is common practice to increase an individual patient's goal hemoglobin A1c value in the context of clinical and social co-morbidities, but this goal value rarely exceeds 8%.  Furthermore, the Minnesota Department of Health has defined poorly controlled T2D as hemoglobin A1c≥8% for the purposes of mandatory reporting by clinical sites across the state100.  Therefore, we will use this value in keeping with common clinical practice to determine eligibility for the study.   \n \n     The first step in screening for eligible participants is identification of Hispanic patients at both study sites with T2D.  Per state-wide reporting mandates, each site maintains registries of their primary care patients with diabetes and the most recent hemoglobin A1c value for each patient.  The second step in screening is to identify Hispanic adults within the subset of patients with the most recent hemoglobin A1c≥8% at both sites. Both sites have identified mechanisms for accurately identifying eligible patients (see letters of support).  In our pilot study, we identified 3,025 eligible patients across both sites. Based on our pilot data, we expect to recruit approximately 50% women.  Children were not included because of perceived community need that resulted in an intervention created for adults, and because of the relatively higher prevalence of T2D among adults.\n\nOur preliminary data suggest that we may expect a moderate effect size for the intervention (25%-50% times the standard deviation).  This is similar to two recent meta-analyses127,128 of related work that informs the effect size we can expect to observe in the proposed study. The first meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials examined the efficacy of diabetes self-management education added to usual care among Hispanic patients in primary care settings, which produced an average hemoglobin A1c reduction of 0.25 standard deviations127. The second meta-analysis of 20 randomized trials evaluated the efficacy of diabetes self-management education among racial/ethnic minority populations, which showed a similar hemoglobin A1c reduction of 0.31 standard deviations128.  While these effects sizes are smaller than that of our pilot study, we have picked the more conservative (lower) estimate of effect size to ensure ample sample size.  Hence, we can expect an effect likely to be between 0.25 and 0.31 standard deviation for the type of intervention proposed. Required sample sizes for an independent samples t-test to detect these two effect sizes, assuming 80% power, a two-tailed alternative and a 5% Type I error rate, are 252 and 145 patients per group, respectively.  With 200 patients per group, we will have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.28 standard deviations via the independent samples t-test.  Accounting for approximately 12% loss to follow-up, we intend to recruit 225 patients in each group, for a total sample size of 450 participants.	2	0	\N	1
87	48	\N	36	Randomization: Upon eligibility, a statistician randomizes all subjects in a 1:1 ratio to the placebo or losartan treatment group and informs the research pharmacy. Participants will be stratified by site during randomization. Design: The basic study design consists of random assignment of patients to one of two treatment arms: losartan or placebo. Data will be collected at the visits as outlines above.              Sample Size Calculation: Sample size calculation has been performed treating CFTR conductance as a continuous variable. Data from Rowe et al were used for estimated group sample sizes of 18. This sample size achieves 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal means when the DNPD mean difference is -5.0 with a standard deviation for both groups of 5.2 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample equal-variance t-test. Even with 20% attrition, the power remains acceptable using most-polarized nostril at each visit.	3	\N	\N	\N

Since previous studies involving multiple centers in critical care medicine have reported an ICC between 0.001 - 0.05, power calculations were conducted in this range of ICCs. The pooled SD utilized in the calculation was estimated from the previous work from Grissom et al., in which the reported SD of MSOFA ranged from 2.7 to 3.2. If we assume 4 centers per treatment group (a total of 8 participating centers), a treatment phase of 5 months, and ICU recruitment of 38 patients per month, the sample size will be 750 patients per treatment group.

The study populations will of course tie to the interventions and while it is not possible to prespecify the study population precisely, in general and descriptive terms, for prevention trials, the expectation would be that the study population would likely be entirely asymptomatic, asymptomatic at risk, or in the early symptomatic stages of prodromal AD.

Adjusting for potential data loss due to attrition, 90% statistical power to detect a significant 37% reduction in reattempt rates at 5% overall type I error would require 1862 subjects.

Recent trends of decreasing event rates in patients with stable CHD let us assume a conservative estimate of 6% for both the NEM and CEM arms. We determined our goal for a 95% confidence interval to include an event rate difference of �1.4% among the two strategies. Sample sizes were calculated using the binomial distribution with Pearson Chi-Square (two-sided) confidence intervals, assuming 90% power and alpha=0.05. With event rates of 6% in each arm, our requisite sample size is 4,758 (2,379 in each arm) with 90% power, alpha of 0.05 and follow up loss of 7%.   We anticipate approximately 30-40% of patients to be female. Average age will be 60 years.

The MA Cancer Registry also identified six health systems in Boston that care for over 90% of these women. Therefore, we have partnered with these six health systems for this study. They include: 1.

Patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and who provide informed consent will be enrolled in the study.The high prevalence of AF, the growing role of rhythm control (specifically ablation), and the distribution of risk factors in the AF population (the majority of whom have a CHADSVASC score < 4) make it likely that patients meeting the entry criteria are commonly seen in any busy EP and general cardiology practice. Furthermore, anticoagulation use is a concern to many patients and it can be expected that many patients would be interested in a clinical trial aimed at reducing anticoagulation exposure, particularly one that utilizes a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive approach.	120	\N	\N	\N

59	42	\N	90	We will enroll obese subjects (BMI > 30) scheduled to undergo routine screening colonoscopy. I have conducted two prior single-site studies of this nature in the colonoscopy suite at Tufts Medical Center quite successfully, resulting in three published studies and one abstract (1.   Kim YI, et al. Am J Gastroenterol. 2001;96: 184-95; 2.  Kim YI, et al. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2001;10: 715-9.; 3.   Kim YI, et al. Am J Clin Nutr 1998;68: 866-72.; 4.    Pfalzer A, et al.  FASEB J 2014;28 (suppl 1): 136.6[abstr]).  The most recent of the two prior studies recruited a mean of 6 subjects per month.  Since our sample size estimates indicate that we will require 90 subjects (see statistics section), we project it will take 5-6 months to recruit the necessary number of individuals.    The biggest anticipated obstacle will be the reluctance of prospective subjects to enroll when the study will require an additional limited colonoscopy four weeks after the first procedure.  We will provide an IRB-designated amount of stipend for each participant, which will encourage (but not unduly coerce) participation. The appropariate handling of the biopsies after they are obtained will be imporant, and we feel that since there will be only 3 study sites we will have the opportunity to be highly selective, ensuring that each site has suitable personnel that have both the experience and diligence that will be needed.	3	\N	\N	\N
170	45	f	300	Three hundred patient sample size.  Prior studies of vestibular rehabilitation have shown a benefit relative to placebo with as few as 40 patients.  We plan to enroll more than this because home based vestibular rehabilitation programs have historically been less effective.  One such study which demonstrated a significant but modest effect enrolled 240 patients, thus if an effect cannot be shown in a study that size it is likely that the effect is not clinically significant.  In the one prior study that measured compliance with a home vestibular rehabilitation technique it was poor (<50%). This compliance rate is worse than is typical of medication based trials but is also consistent with our preliminary experience with the AVR.  Thus a larger enrollment is needed to make up for poor compliance.  It is expected that about 60% (180 patients) will make it through the run in period and become randomized (90 per group).  An additional 20% may drop out during testing leaving 76 patients in each group.  It has previously been reported that a DHI score of 18 points with a test score standard deviation (SD) of 24 points, or a 42% change from the pre-treatment level is a minimal clinically important difference.  In this study the minimum baseline DHI is 30 thus a 42% decrease would correspond to a 13 point change.  A sample size of 75 subjects per group will provide a 90% power to detect a group difference in mean DHI of 13 points, assuming a standard deviation of 24 points with a two-sided alpha=0.05.\n\nWe imagine an even gender distribution, including patients age 18-80.

However, the caregiver population will likely be the inverse as oftentimes the caregivers are patients spouses.\nAll study participants will be >18.\nWe anticipate that 30% of our study sample will be minority (using the NIH definition:  minority = American Indian / Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or Black [African American]) based on the number of minority patients with advanced heart failure who have undergone VAD implantation as reported by INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support).

Over a 2 year period 500 living kidney donations are anticipated to be performed at the 3 institutions.  80 percent (N = 400) of patients will be between 30 and 60 years of age and therefore eligible for participation in the study (Table 1 and Figure 3).  \n\nInclusion and Exclusion criteria:  Male and female donors of any ages 30-60 years between 0 and 2 years following kidney donation.  \n\nInclusion criteria: 1. Male or female live kidney donors; 2. Age 30 to 60 years; 3. Not currently taking 1-hydroxylated vitamin D analog. 4.  Otherwise healthy and free of disease.  Since live kidney donors undergo stringent examination to ensure normal health at the participating institutions, all live kidney donors by definition will be free of disease.  \nExclusion criteria: 1. Exposure to medications known to affect bone metabolism e.g. corticosteroids within the past 3 months.  As noted above, I have kidney donors are selected for their good health.  Therefore, they will be free of disease.  However, we will specifically screen for and exclude the following:  2. Diabetes mellitus, FBG >126 mg/dL; 3. Proteinuria >3 g/24 h; 4. Vasculitis, inflammatory or neurological diseases; 5.  Vascular disease.  6. Active malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma; 7. Heart, lung or liver disease.\n\nAllocation of subjects to groups: Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. Participants will be randomized to groups who will receive therapy for 48 months: Group 1 (Placebo, N = 100), and Group 2 (1,25(OH)2D3, 0.25 micrograms orally once/day; N = 100) using the Simon-Pocock algorithm  balancing for age, sex and ethnicity. The rationale for the doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 to be used is that 1,25(OH)2D3 has a production rate of 1-2 mcg/ day. 1,25(OH)2D3 production in patients following living kidney donation should be equivalent to that seen in patients with CKD 3-4.  Production is reduced but not zero, and therefore 0.25 mcg/day should provide sufficient or nearly sufficient 1,25(OH)2D3 to normalize or nearly normalize 1,25(OH)2D3 levels. Doses of 0.5-4 mcg/day orally are safely used for treatment of 2o HPT in CKD/ESKD49,50. The placebo and 1,25(OH)2D3 will be prepared in the Research Pharmacy, MCR. Drs. Kumar, Kasiske and Matas and their study coordinators will monitor medication compliance by assessing capsule counts.	3	0	\N	2

A sample size of 3,268 would provide power of at least 80% for detecting a 5% difference in the rate of CT use.  As missed intra-abdominal injuries will be exceedingly rare, a sample size calculation was not calculated but we would expect approximately three cases for a sample size of 3,268 patients.  Based on preliminary data demonstrating a 12% difference in abdominal CT rates in children 0 - 3 years of age, we will specifically enroll a sample to detect at least a 10% difference in abdominal CT rates in this age cohort.  Assuming a baseline CT rate of 50% in all strata, a sample size of 814 patients in this age cohort would provide a power of at least 80% for detecting a 10% difference in the rate of abdominal CT use between groups.\n\nGender:  We will enroll all patients regardless of gender.

While the investigative team has led HF trials with robust enrollment of African Americans (30% of the HF-ACTION cohort),57 we have incorporated additional strategies to improve the enrollment of underrepresented minorities for targeted enrollment of 35%. By systematically identifying eligible patients during hospitalization (rather than outpatient clinic visits) and having no site-dependent follow-up visits, the proposed study conduct will reduce bias against the enrollment and retention of disadvantaged groups.

138	48	\N	16	Sample size: Based on prior studies of MCC in CF at UNC, there is a strong correlation  between repeat baseline measures of Ave90Clr in CF patients (R=0.81, n=13). Repeat measures showed a SD of delta Ave90Clr for two baselines of 6% with a mean baseline Ave90Clr of 20%. Using these values, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, a sample size of 12 subjects will allow us to detect an absolute difference in deltaAveClr90 of 5% or a 25% improvement in MCC/CC. This is one half the 50% improvement in MCC afforded by both 2-week administration of 7% hypertonic saline in CF patients and administration of aerosolized losartan in the sheep model after 3 day challenges with CFTRinh172+HNE. Thus, an n=16 (repeat measures of 4 patients/year) should provide sufficient power (0.90) to observe an improvement of MCC/CC with losartan treatment in our CF cohort if present, even if there will be dropouts.	2	\N	\N	\N

The demographic group from which we will recruit is defined by people who are provider-referred or self-referred and meet eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening. In the Mayo Clinic lung screening program we have screened 835 patients in the past 12 months, 43% women and 57% men.  We will recruit smokers age 55 and up from the general population encompassing the catchment areas surrounding the study sites.  The study sites include hospitals in large metropolitan area is (Phoenix, AZ and Jacksonville, FL), medium-sized cities in the Midwest (Rochester, MN, population 115,000), and smaller rural or regional referral centers located in the upper Midwest (LaCrosse, WI population 53,000; Eau Claire WI, population 67,000 and Mankato, MN population 42,000).	6	0	\N	1

371	39	f	1100	1,100 patients with a recent embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) and evidence of atrial cardiopathy. We anticipated screening approximately 4400 patients with ESUS, of whom we anticipated ~25% would meet on of the three biomarker criteria for atrial cardiopathy. Enrolment began in February 2018. Of the first 150 patients consented and screened, 64 have been eligible (43%). Patients are being recruited from 120 hospitals participating in the NIH StrokeNet consortium; 67 sites are already recruiting, and the remaining 53 sites are completing paperwork. \nInclusion or exclusion of subjects will not differ based on sex/gender, and the aim is to recruit similar numbers of men and women. The absence of an upper age limit will aid recruitment of women given that they are generally older than men at the time of a first cardiovascular event such as stroke.\nInclusion or exclusion of subjects will not differ based on race/ethnicity. To ensure representative enrollment of minority groups, site PIs and their clinical research staff have been trained and are periodically reminded to:\n•\tBe mindful of cultural, historical, social, and political factors that may influence minority participation. It should be noted that many individuals (particularly certain racial/ethnic groups) need clarification on what a clinical trial is; understanding of what type of research is being conducted; who is conducting the research study, benefits to individuals and the community; place of worship's encouragement, etc.\n•\tEmphasize that the goal is to recruit patients regardless of race or ethnicity.\n•\tClearly explain that the purpose of informed consent is to protect, not relinquish, participants' rights.\n•\tProvide time if necessary between screening and randomization for patients to reflect and discuss participation with family.\n•\tEmphasize the proven track record of the study drugs.\n•\tEmphasize the trial's potential to help find better treatments to prevent stroke.\n•\tMitigate concern about randomization by clearly explaining its rationale and highlighting the possibility of cross over if clinically indicated.\n•\tEmphasize that participants will be kept up to date on scientific developments in this field throughout their participation in the trial.\n•\tThink about modes of communication for outreach and retention, such as follow-up phone calls, social media campaigns, text messaging, to identify what works best for the community/population (as allowed by local regulations).\n•\tProvide translation services or bilingual staff, if needed for recruiting populations for which English is not the primary language.\n•\tUse motivational interviewing techniques as a method to improve communication between the research coordinator and patient population to enhance recruitment efforts. This includes investigators and staff taking the time to understand the patient's personal circumstances that may well affect enrollment and follow-up.	120	0	\N	25

Our two primary mechanisms of recruitment will be through screening and referrals. We will screen through clinical networks using Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and will contact all patients in practices aged 60 and older who in the recent past were prescribed or are currently taking antidepressants. Referrals will be elicited from practitioners and through in-practice advertisements to patients and their caregivers specifically asking if the doctor, patient, or caregiver describes the clinical situation as treatment resistant or difficult to treat.	5	1	Canada	4

78	41	f	1000	The study population will be composed of pregnant women of mixed parity (nulliparous and multiparous) who have a moderate quantity of prenatal risk for cesarean delivery as measured by the modified published AMOR-IPAT risk scoring system. It is assumed that the study population will come from the general population of the investigational sites involved with the study. The study will, by intention, recruit subjects with a balanced mix of subject features (parity, race, ethnicity and insurance status). Monitoring of characteristics of randomized subjects will be used to guide subsequent enrollment, especially towards the end of the study. The greatest emphasis of study balance will be on parity status and race.        The intent of the study is to enroll a group of pregnant patients who have moderate levels of prenatal risk for cesarean delivery. As such, the study population will not include subjects with minimal risk for cesarean delivery, and will not include subjects who, at 37 weeks 4 days, have developed an accepted 'indication' for delivery prior to 40 weeks of gestation.  It is assumed that all study sites will recruit subjects equally from all clinical sites as directed by the IRB of each site.	5	\N	\N	\N

449	18	f	1330	We plan to enroll 1,330 current smokers (Table 2). Based on the current demographic characteristics of the screening participants at the 5 sites, we expect that 22% will be non-white, 15% Hispanic, and 50% female. We expect that screening sites will begin to screen a more diverse sample once CMS coverage is fully operational and self-pay is no longer necessary. Further, one of our new sites (Miami Baptist) will provide a substantial number of Hispanic participants. Based on our prior studies, we are conservatively projecting a 45% participation rate due to inclusion of participants at all levels of readiness to quit, a 95% show rate for the CT screening exam, and a 5%-20% loss at each follow-up assessment (Fig. 2). \nScreening Sites: We describe each site here, in Table 2, in the letters of support, and in Resources and Environment.  All 5 screening sites have an ongoing screening program and are part of a major medical center, which includes a thoracic tumor board, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, surgeons, pulmonologists, and palliative care members, who will provide diagnostic work-ups and treatment as needed.  The Georgetown site (DC) was one of the original 10 NLST screening sites and has screened over 160 persons since the clinical screening program began in 2013. The Lahey site (MA) has provided free lung cancer screening to over 3000 individuals since 2012 and is one of the leaders in developing clinical lung screening programs.  Hackensack (NJ) has screened over 130 since beginning screening in 2014.  Miami Baptist (FL) has screened over 1500 individuals since 2014, 40% of whom are Hispanic. Hartford Hospital (CT) has screened 270 individuals over 12 months. Importantly, although Lahey and Baptist are already operating at close to capacity, the other 3 sites are continuing to increase the annual number screened.  We have added two additional sites:  Unity Point in Moline Illinois, and Medstar Shah Medical Group in Hollywood, MD.	7	0	\N	1
32	35	f	8800	The study population will be all ED patients ages 6 months to <18 years with clinician concern for septic shock, as operationalized below in Section 11 'Entry Criteria'.    Potential recruitment challenges include:    a)    Need for enrollment of a high proportion of eligible patients to reduce selection bias and meet sample size requirements.    Proposed solutions are to ensure equipoise of participating ED clinicians through education of study rationale, design, and endpoints and establishing enrollment practices that can be easily embedded within normal clinical workflow. Notably, an advantage of using PECARN is their demonstrable success with enrollment into prior clinical trials.(34-36)    b)   Need to exclude patients who require minimal fluid resuscitation for mild dehydration, which represents most fluid bolus administrations in the pediatric ED.    Proposed solution is to limit enrollment to patients that the clinician judges will require additional fluid beyond an initial 20 mL/kg bolus to treat poor perfusion defined as either hypotension or abnormal capillary refill.(37)    c)    Need to begin study procedures within a very narrow therapeutic window of minutes from presentation while maintaining compliance with ethical human subjects' regulations.    Proposed solution is to seek Federal 'exception from informed consent' (EFIC) due to the life-threatening nature of septic shock and the narrow therapeutic window for fluid resuscitation (on the order of minutes after presentation).  PECARN has prior experience with EFIC in a pediatric clinical trial,(35) and the CHOP IRB (personal communication, Barbara Engel MD, PhD and Mark Schreiner, MD) has agreed that this study proposal meets the ethical standards and requirement to utilize EFIC. An appropriate plan for community consultation and public disclosure will be established under the guidance of Jill Baren, MD, chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at University of Pennsylvania, who has experience coordinating EFIC for a prior pediatric trial through PECARN.(35)	18	\N	\N	16

57	27	\N	50	The target population will include 1st generation immigrants and their caretakers or family members living in ethnic enclaves served by community agencies. The focus will be specifically on immigrants who, once residing in the U.S., belong to one or more U.S. racial/ethnic minority populations (i.e. Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians, or Pacific Islanders). Among these, we are interested in distinct immigrant sub-populations based on the country of origin, rather than larger racial/minority populations when feasible (e.g., Koreans, Vietnamese, Cambodian, etc., rather than Asian Americans).  Racial and ethnic minorities are influenced by various degrees of skepticism related to trial participation.  We anticipate multilevel approaches to address barriers to study participation, such as, distrust; discomfort with inherent uncertainty of trial participation, negative connotation of clinical trial, low education level, and language discordance.

To assess the\nReach of the intervention, we will examine differences in effectiveness across sites, and for patients of different\nages, sex, taking different numbers of medications, and living in zip codes reflecting different median incomes.\nWe hypothesize that the intervention will work best to prevent readmissions, will work equally at both sites, will\nwork better for older patients, those taking more medications, and those from poorer zip codes. However, we\nrecognize that these underpowered analyses may be most useful for shaping future hypotheses. To ensure\nthat no results are misinterpreted, we will report that any negative results may be due to inadequate power.\nThe descriptive phase of analysis will include an assessment of the distributions and correlations of the\naforementioned variables of interest. We will use logistic regression to examine these factors. We will also\nexamine the potential interaction of covariates. We will explore collinearity using the condition index and with\ncareful assessment of the correlation matrix.	2	0	\N	2

205	168	f	118	A convenience sample of adults with PMS will be recruited from the study sites. The multi-site design of the trial is intended to promote generalizability of the study results. \n\nThe sample size and power analysis were based on the pilot LA in SPMS trial in which LA had improved time to complete the T25FW (-0.54 seconds SD 0.36 vs 0.14 SD 0.25, p = 0.06). A sample size of 44 per group will have 80% power to detect a difference between the LA group with a coefficient, β1 regression slope of -0.50 seconds and the placebo group coefficient, β2 slope of -1.00, assuming that the standard deviation of the difference between the groups is 2.20 and the standard deviation of the residuals (repeated measures within each participant) is 1.80 with a 0.05 two-sided significance level and the correlation of 0.85 between the measurements over time, which if lower increases the power. A sample size of 59 per arm will allow for a 25% drop-out rate.\n\nNo special efforts will be undertaken to recruit specific sub-populations. Specifically, MS, like other autoimmune diseases, has a predilection for affecting women in a 3-4:1 ratio. Therefore we expect women to be adequately represented in this current study using a convenience sample. Minorities will not be preferentially recruited as there is no data to suggest a differential effect of LA on specific minority populations and/or with particular genetic characteristics. MS is rare in children, and progressive forms of MS rare within this small population. Therefore no children will be enrolled.\n\nThe pilot LA trial recruited 21 Veterans of the total 51 from VA Portland Health Care System which serves 2-300 Veterans with MS. The current proposed study has more restrictive inclusion criteria than the pilot study, requiring that subjects are ambulatory.

Patients frequently, in describing their experience after spinal cord injury, relate that they had a period of denial and a fierce hope that their injury would be temporary.  For instance, a patient recently described to one of our PIs that at 6 weeks when an occupational therapist came into his rehab to fit him for a wheelchair he asked them to leave because he felt so strongly that he was going to walk out of rehabilitation.  People after spinal cord injury are also not thinking about their long-term bladder management as necessarily a problem.  In fact, it may be only later that bladder problems become recognized as a primary concern in their overall QoL.\n\nA tenant of our study is that early intervention is essential to preserving favorable dynamics in the bladder with sacral nerve stimulation and for this reason we plan starting nerve stimulation within 3 months of injury.  In fact, we would prefer to do the needed surgery as soon as possible and believe it may be more effective if we do it in the first 6 weeks.  The surgery is reversible leaving only small scars, but even so we have major concerns about finding a way to effectively engage patients so they would consider entering the study.  We are hopeful that by engaging patients and the staff of the RIC that we could gain valuable insight in how best to present the concepts underlying a randomized study and the potential benefits of participation.	5	0	\N	3

Children and adults will be actively recruited.  Age limitation only relates to the ability to undergo ABPM (as young as 6 years of age). Because all subjects will have whole exome sequencing we are recruiting only a single racial/ethnic group, white/non-Hispanic, to avoid the confounding that would occur if other racial and/or ethnic groups were included. All analyses will include the first three principal component eigenvalues as covariates to adjust for population structure (race/ethnicity) \n\nGeneral health status: The general health status of our study subjects will be typical for the TS population.  \n\nGeographic location: This multicenter study will recruit subjects who are evenly distributed geographically across the USA.

339	29	f	1500	Specific Aim 1: Patients will be recruited from primary care clinics.\nA Barrett's Esophagus prevalence of 8% in the population and a test sensitivity and specificity of 95% are assumed. Using an estimated PPV of 0.3, a sample size of 89 test positives produces a two-sided 95% confidence interval with a width equal to 0.199. Assuming the NPV will be high (0.9), a sample size of 158 test positives produces a two-sided 95% confidence interval with a width equal to 0.1. Hence the SOS will be performed in approximately 1100 patients to obtain these test positive numbers. We estimate 100 test positives will undergo confirmatory testing with endoscopy and 200 test negative patients will undergo confirmatory endoscopy.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Patients will be recruited from Endoscopy units in medical centers. Patients will be undergoing clinically indicated endoscopy.\nA sample size of 400 True negatives and 200 True positives will be needed to make precise estimates of specificity and sensitivity as well as their respective determinants. Using the true positives and negatives from AIm 1, we will need an additional 200 true negatives and 100 true positives recruited for this aim.\n\nSpecific Aim 3: 60 patients with dysplasia will be needed in this aim along with an equal number of non-dysplastic BE patients as controls. Samples of patients from AIms 1 and 2 will be utilized in this aim.	6	0	\N	6

359	29	f	960	Sample size calculation: \nFor a prospective randomized trial in detecting high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) comparing the Seattle protocol, the current standard practice, to wide-area transepithelial sampling (WATS), the following sample sizes were calculated assuming α=0.05 and power of 0.9. All calculations are completed using PROC POWER in SAS 9.4 for McNemar's test for paired nominal data.\nThe sample size needed to detect a difference between proposed discordant proportions of 0.3575% for Seattle protocol positive and WATS negative to 3.11% for WATS positive and Seattle protocol negative is 960. These estimates are derived from prior pooled data for dysplasia detection rates of 4.9% for WATS alone and 2.5% for Seattle protocol alone, with the discordant proportions of test results derived from data reported in Vennalaganti assuming that only 50% of WATS positive and Seattle protocol negative cases are verified with targeted follow-up biopsies to confirm the diagnosis.	10	0	\N	5
462	51	f	400	Male and female subjects between the ages of 14-45 who have been experiencing symptoms of post-concussive syndrome (PCS)  for at least 3 days, but not more than three months after their injury. The control group will consist of 14-45 year old males and females without a history of head injury. We are seeking to recruit 200 concussed individuals, as well as 200 controls. Health requirements include the ability to exercise, for which we have a screening ?'air. The geography will be defined by the set of participating centers, all of whom already have ongoing concussion research programs and successful recruitment strategies.	6	0	\N	6

Due to the non-random geographic prevalence of the sickle globin gene, it is expected that a majority of participants will be of African descent. \nGeneral health status:Based on extensive prior cohort studies, the health status of participants is expected to progressively decline over the course of  the study.\nGeographic location: United States	26	0	\N	25

243	19	f	250	Based on previously published observational studies and small randomized trials, an anticipated venous thromboembolic event rate of 12.6% within 3 months for patients randomized to placeo is expected (thrombus propagation rate of 5.4%, pulmonary embolism rate of 0.5% and recurrent venous thrombosis rate of 6.7%).   We hypothesize that the placebo arm will result in a 3 month event rate of 10%.  By comparison, thromboembolic outcomes in the AMPLIFY trial for those subjects randomized to apixaban was 2.3% at 6 months.  We therefore hypothesize that the apixaban arm will result in a 3 month event rate of 1.6% in the proposed trial.  Based on these assumptions, employing an overall two-sided significance of 0.05 and a target power of 80%,  a sample size of 121 per arm would be required. This estimate is rounded to 125/group (250 total) to account for minor attrition to the intention to treat analysis set.  \n\nPotential subjects will include both genders, ages 18 to 99 years, with confirmed acute calf vein thrombosis and able to provide written informed consent.  These subjects may be either outpatient or hospitalized.	3	0	\N	1

430	\N	\N	\N	No further support.  After further discussion in the VUMC IRB office, we feel it is not in our best interest as a TIN CIRB to take on this study at this time. There are several contributing factors, primarily the potential participating sites are unknown, and we cannot determine whether or not they will be engaged in the research when the study begins. Additionally, we do not know how much has been budgeted for CIRB review/coordination. In our experience, these variables are seldom a good fit for CIRB services only and would not lend to innovative approaches relative to CIRB. If the study is funded, we understand that CIRB review will be required, so some other review options we would recommend are seeking Single IRB review from your home institution at the University of Washington (this would likely be the best option), or utilizing a commercial IRB.	\N

216	\N	f	\N	-Representatives of the Utah TIC and IRB reviewed the process of initiating a CIRB. The responsibilities of the each party were explained along with the tools available.  The tools discussed specific to this trial were SMART IRB Agreement, SMART IRB Exchange, Informed Consent Builder, and ERICA (Utah IRB platform).\n-University of Utah can act as the CIRB for this study.  5 of the 5 proposed sites have already signed up to use the SMART IRB agreement and all 5 sites have already signed up to use the SMART IRB exchange agreement.\n-4 of the 5 sites are CTSA sites	\N
463	Discussed protocol procedures, recruitment, consent considerations and participating sites as related to SIRB standards.	f	\N	The Utah TIC supports approval of SIRB services for this project.	\N

250	A working protocol was supplied by the investigator and only minor updates occurred during the initial consultation.  TIC expressed concern with absence of death within the endpoints and urged the investigator to consider using MSOFA as an ordinal outcome and add a new highest level for death. Though valid reasons exist for choosing a traditional cluster randomized approach, the TIC urged the investigator to consider a sequential, stepped wedge design to keep the number of sites at a manageable level.   Based on review of the protocol, lack of pre-existing evidence, and NIH concerns about feasibility of the intervention, the TIC recommended a feasibility study including a small number of sites to evaluate and refine intervention adherence. \n\nIn response to our concerns, the study investigator elected to re-design the protocol to reduce its scope to a feasibility study and bring it back for review by the TIC once adjusted.  Other commitments prevented him from making significant process between March and August.  Through regular follow-up communication he indicated more assistance with protocol and grant development from the TIN would be beneficial and indicated the desire to move forward with a comprehensive consultation. \n\nThe investigator stated he was advised by the Mayo IRB that a waiver of consent would apply in this scenario given the cluster randomized design.  However, some concern was raised by the TIC/RIC team regarding this approach, considering the collection of patient-level data needed to support analysis of the proposed outcomes.  Further explanation of the requirements and rationale for waiver of consent were provided to the investigator by the Vanderbilt CIRB resources.	t	\N	Use of CIRB in this study would be beneficial to leverage the CTSA network.  Small number of sites, but they are all planned to be CTSA or affiliates.	Use of SA in this study would be beneficial to leverage the CTSA network.  Small number of sites, but they are all planned to be CTSA or affiliates.
280	\N	f	\N	The Utah Trial Innovation Center recommends providing CIRB services for this project. The University of Arizona will serve as the lead site and clinical coordinating center. The University of Utah will be the data coordinating center. The enrolling sites will be:  Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Children's National Medical Center, and University of Oklahoma Health Science Center.\n\nDuring the consultation, the Utah TIC provided education to the lead site regarding the Trial Innovation Network CIRB process and their CIRB responsibilities as a lead site. We are happy to provide a copy of the CIRB consultation slides presented by Annie Risenmay if the study team will find this helpful.\n\nThe Utah TIC advised Lynn Gerald and Jamie Goodwin that a separate consent form will need to be drafted for the participating school healthcare workers. The IRB will also need to see a copy of the survey completed by the school healthcare workers.	\N

409	The team discussed alternative study designs, modifications and benefits / barriers.  Statistical plan was reviewed and the group discussed the possibility of borrowing across effects to optimize the design of RCT and Observational sites.	t	\N	Discussed but determined use of the Investigator's local IRB was preferred.	\N

206	Project is very specific response a very specific RFA and I had no concerns about it.	f	\N	Vanderbilt should be the cIRB;  if resources are a concern, Utah should be the cIRB.  All sites are CTSA Hubs or affiliates.  There are only nine sites.	Chicago will negotiate the contracts, but the TIC that assumes cIRB responsibility will also provide consultation to their contractors if required for executing the standard agreements.
323	\N	\N	\N	Recommend moving forward with CIRB services	\N
464	This study PI already has a strong screening protocol in place. They are re-competing for funding again. The main objective of this consult is to discuss the possibility of TrialNet collaborating and partnering with the TIN to create innovations and cost efficiencies around their screening protocol, Pathway to Prevention.	f	\N	\N	\N
78	Specific Aims, Protocol Development & Analysis: The OULI Trial proposal is a multi-center randomized\nclinical trial to determine if the use of Active Management of Risk in Pregnancy at Term (AMOR-IPAT) will lead\nto improved childbirth outcome as compared to more standard and less personalized approaches to term\npregnancy management. Dr. Nicholson's original proposal on February 10 included 4 arms: AMOR-IPAT\n(experimental group), induction of labor (IOL) at 39 weeks, IOL at 40 weeks and IOL at 41 weeks. N = 1000. It\nalso included both nulliparous and multiparous women. When Dr. Nicholson presented on March 29th, he cut \none arm (IOL at 41 weeks) and limited recruitment to only multiparous women based on feedback he received\nfrom the Utah TIC.\nThe primary endpoint of this study will be the modified Weighted Adverse Outcome Index Score (mWAOI\nScore). The mWAOI Score is based on the published and validated 10-item Weighted Adverse Outcome Index\nScore but has the addition of two other items: cesarean delivery and complicated NICU admission.\nNo formal power calculation was provided in the proposal to project the sample size. Dr. Nicholson anticipates\nneeding 1000 subjects, split evenly among each arm, to provided clinically statistical results.\nCurrently in the obstetrics field, IOL is not recommended prior to 39 weeks of age. AMOR-IPAT tool has the\npotential to recommend IOL before 38 weeks of age. There is a trial currently being conducted that will have\nimpact on how Dr. Nicholson should design his trial. This is the ARRIVE Trial which is currently being\nconducted in the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network which is studying IOL at 39 weeks vs expected\nmanagement of pregnancy in nulliparous mothers. The Utah TIC has made the following recommendations\npresuming ARRIVE Trial data will show better outcomes for IOL at 39 weeks:\n• Limit the study to two arms : IOL at 39 weeks and AMOR-IPAT\n• Screen subjects with AMOR-IPAT during the screening process and only include those that will be\ninduced prior to 39 weeks.\n• Keep the restriction to multiparous mothers.\n• Provide specific guidelines to the participating physicians so there is less practice variability.\n• Consider looking at common intermediate outcomes rather than less common severe clinical outcomes.\n• Ensure all surveys measures used in the study are validated.\n• Implement a governance committee to make determinations on defining terms in the protocol.\n• Collect length of stay post induction for mother and infant (dates and times of admission and discharge)\nto simplify costs collection.\n• Simulation power calculations should be done for grant submission. Increasing projected enrollment will\nlikely be necessary.\nPreparing a Strong Grant Proposal / Grantsmanship\nDr. Nicholson has been developing the AMOR-IPAT scoring tool over the last 20 year. He has submitted\ngrants in the past that have not made it to study session. The following recommendations were made:\n• Stay in contact with the program officer, Uma Reddy and get advice regarding study section.\n• Begin writing grant early.\n• Have Penn State CTSI do a mock review of the grant; begin writing early; attend a grant writing\nworkshop.\n• Submit grant in February 2018 or later, in order to incorporate the results of the ARRIVE Trial.\n• Have a perinatologist and a neonatologist on the grant with a multiple PI plan.\nSite Recruitment\nDr. Nicholson originally proposed that his study could be accomplished with five sites in total. During Phase II\nof the consult, her proposed using three sites. The Utah TIC made the following recommendations:\n• Intentionally include sites with different racial and ethnic demographics in order to evaluate\ngeneralizability of the results to multiple races and ethnicities.\n• Advise not to enroll at Hershey as this could introduce bias into the trial.\n\nUPDATE Mar 2018:\n-Cut from 4 to 2 spec aims	t	\N	We can likely provide CIRB services but will make this determination if approved for a comprehensive consultation.

341	The investigator supplied a protocol synopsis, which was discussed during the initial consultation. As the primary endpoint centers on adverse events, the team discussed the possibility of identifying events of interest for this patient population, and confirmed that a DSMB would be utilized to monitor safety. Key concerns, for which the investigator is requesting input are 1) the low frequency of the disease (especially BPD that develops pulmonary hypotension) and 2) equipoise to placebo. There is little to no data currently that supports off-label use of sildenafil in this patient population, and sites that offer sildenafil as standard of care for BPD would likely need to be excluded from participation. Because of the low frequency of BPD in premature neonates, the team is planning to recruit up to 30 enrolling sites to enroll the target 120 patients over 2 years. With such a low patient/site recruitment rate (<4 patients/site at most sites), the need to control for background therapy issues was discussed. The investigator is seeking input on trial design, analysis plans, and recruitment strategies to maximize enrollment and study outcomes.	f	\N	High level CIRB discussions occurred during the kick-off meeting, but a more in depth discussion will occur with the study team during the comprehensive consultation.

15	Topic 1: Real-Time Electronic Data Capture in the Field Discussion Summary \nIMMEDIATE-1, IMMEDIATE-2, and AVERT trial approaches to field data capture as related to meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were discussed. IMMEDIATE-1 and IMMEDIATE-2 use a clinical diagnosis plus defibrillator measures of cardiac ischemia to identify correct patients. During the IMMEDIATE-1 trial, aspects of this process were built in to defibrillators, but this will not be available in IMMEDIATE-2. A key aspect in IMMEDIATE-1 was feedback on accuracy of recruitment adherence to the local sites; this required a weekly manual data transfer process back and forth from each site. The AVERT trial's current approach to data capture was described, including using the software "Digivey" as a platform for real time data capture, central management, and integration across multiple sites. The possibility of using the AVERT/Digivey approach for IMMEDIATE-2 was discussed, and it was determined this might be a beneficial trial innovation. Connecting EMS Defibrillators directly to the IMMEDIATE-2 data center for real time data capture could be possible. The proposed innovation was to piggyback a data capture "meta-trial" on top of the planned IMMEDIATE-2 trial. This meta-trial's goal would be to address a secondary trials innovation hypothesis focused on improving correct trial patient identification. Real-time central data capture combined with central, real-time management of enrollment criteria could lead to fewer false positive and false negatives recruitments, as well as more efficient site management and feedback.\n\nA. Recommendations to Principal Investigator PI\n\n1. Consider direct connection from EMS devices to local database so that the data are transferred in real time.  \n2. Consider linking to more a comprehensive data collection structure, such as extract data from EPIC.\n3. Consider clustered randomized trial on 2 different initial data collection procedures. Group 1 will consist of real time transfer from EMS with central data management and Group 2 will consist of existing local model. The purpose of this is to see if these procedures improve accuracy and pace of recruitment. \n4. The feasibility, innovation effect size, and effect on recruitment can be modeled utilizing the weekly site screening and recruitment data over the time course of the Immediate 1 trial.  The Immediate 1 trial leadership will have to decide if they wish to have the above "innovation" embedded in their trial. \n\nB. Recommendations for a Comprehensive Consult \n\n1. The PI could consider using a piggyback "innovation meta-trial" of centralized management of field data capture process if this project was carried forward to a comprehensive consult. In this approach, half of the sites would be allocated to receive the standard data feedback loop and the other half would be randomized to a fully electronic feedback approach. The real time feedback loop is a potential trial innovation. This project will be able to test the hypothesis that the real time feedback loop will lead to more accurate adherence to trial enrollment criteria (fewer false positives/negatives) and improved site management (shorter time to full recruitment capacity). \n\nTopic 2: Statistical Analysis Plan Discussion Summary     \nThere are 3 composite outcomes for the primary endpoint: 1) Mortality 30-Day, 2) Cardiac Arrest, and 3) MI Infarct Size for the proposed study.  The non-parametric method of Finkelstein and Schoenfeld will be used to calculate the difference in treatment groups in this composite endpoint. Comparisons are made for the outcomes in all pair-wise patient combinations. For example, a mortality for one patient is scored higher when compared to patients who have a cardiac arrest or the other patient's infarct size in the absence of death or cardiac arrest. In contrast, the scores are equivalent if the patient pair has the same outcome event.  \n\nSimulations to estimate the power of this study were done using data from IMMEDIATE trial. Hopkins statistical consultants asked to see details of these simulations if it is appropriate to share these results. \n\nDiscussions centered on the study populations. In the initial study, the patient population was taken from in pre-hospital setting. Problems occurred with this approach because treatment with the GIK occurred too late in some cases. For the proposed IMMEDIATE 2 study, the patient population will also include the people coming to the ED (about half of the patients come to the ED in ways besides arriving in an ambulance). The median time to treatment in the pre-hospital setting (first trial) was 90 minutes and IQR 30 minutes to 2.5 hours. It is possible that there will be a difference in time distribution in the ED versus pre-hospital setting.\n\nA. Issues Identified  \n1. A simple randomization method to assign patients to treatment arms is proposed. However, concern was expressed about potential chance imbalances in major prognostic factors.  To prevent potential imbalance in important prognostic factors, one possible solution is to use covariate adaptive randomization (see Pocock SJ and Simon R. "Sequential treatment assignment with balancing for prognostic factors in the controlled clinical trial." Biometrics 1975: 31: 103-15).  \n\n2. Finkelstein-Schoenfeld (FS) method - Concerns were expressed that any imbalance in prognostic variables can't be controlled for in a multivariable model given that the FS method is a non-parametric method. However, the FS outcome can be computed under stratification.\n\n3. Concerns were raised about possible controlling for the multiple comparisons as many outcomes seemed to overlap among the primary and secondary specific aims. \n\n4. There was some concern expressed on the data used to estimate the effect of GIK on heart failure used in the power analyses. The investigators based the estimated effect size on 10 studies, representing different treatment regiments. Concerns were raised that the number trials considered is small, and that the infarct size is on the study level and not the individual, patient level. However, this issue was given a lower priority since there was a feeling that the analytical methods used by the PIs on these data were innovative, and that the data from these 10 studies was meant to supplement data obtained from the IMMEDIATE 1 study.  \n\nB. Recommendations to Principal Investigator \n\n1. It was suggested that the analytical text note a stratified FS statistic by important prognostic factors will be calculated if imbalances in the randomization are identified. \n\n2. It was recommended that a 3x3 table be created that describes the joint probability of each pair-wise outcome combination that includes mortality, cardiac arrest data, and use of infarct size data. A similar table has been reported on the consort diagram in the original trial for infarct size.  This data would benefit planning and grant review, making explicit the distribution of the outcome measures in the composite score.\n\n3. Further investigation should be undertaken to consider if one of the three endpoints might dominate the power of the study as well as the final analyses, or if these three outcomes are equally informative on the composite endpoint. \n\n4. It was recommended that mortality times, with uncertainty, could be estimated for patients who are censored, and alternative FS scores calculated using these mortality estimates. These alternative scores can then be compared to FS scores under censoring as a way to determine how sensitive the FS methods is to the censoring of mortality.  \n\n5. It was recommended that weights be applied to calibrate the distribution of pre-hospital data to make this comparable to the time-to-treatment distribution that we might expect to see in the ED setting.  \n \n6. If this project is awarded with a comprehensive consult we could review the power sample size simulations described in the statistical analysis plan.	f	\N	Topic 3: Central IRB Discussion Summary\nUpon review of the initial information about the IMMEDIATE-2 trial, the following were included as summary recommendations from the JHU TIC CIRB:\n\nA. Consent and Use of Legally Authorized Representatives\nAs clinical trials that will be conducted under the Exception from Informed Consent [EFIC] regulations have specific regulatory requirements related to efforts that must be made to attempt to secure consent from a legally authorized representative (LAR), the TIC CIRB noted that the expansion of the study design to include in-hospital administration might trigger a heightened need to develop a plan that incorporates use of a legally authorized representative, where feasible.  To further advise on any requirements related to the use of an LAR, the TIC CIRB requested a copy of the following:\n1. The IMMEDIATE Trial protocol, including any outline of how consent via LAR was factored into the consenting plan for the original trial.\n2. Data on the number of subjects enrolled in the IMMEDIATE Trial [which included only a population where interventions were initiated in the ambulance] who were initially consented using an LAR. \n\nB. Community Consultation \nThe TIC CIRB noted that one unique aspect of studies conducted under the EFIC regulations is the requirement for development and implementation of a community consultation plan, through which the potentially impacted community might provide feedback on the trial. It was noted that this requirement necessitates a two-part IRB review- first a review of the proposed community consultation plan and the trial as designed and then, subsequent to the conduct of the community consultation initiatives, a second review which includes feedback from the consultation where the protocol may gain full approval if all IRB concerns are addressed. Because of the unique requirements related to community consultation, the TIC CIRB noted one item that would be considered is how to effectively solicit local feedback on the planned consultation activities. This is something that would be more fully explored in a comprehensive consultation. To assist with a more in-depth consultation and assist the study team in developing an appropriate timeline, the TIC CIRB requested the following:\n1. A copy of the community consultation plan created for the IMMEDIATE trial and a summary of any changes made to the protocol and/or consent documents as a result of the consultation activities from this first trial. \n2. Confirmation as to whether a draft of the community consultation plan had been developed and incorporated with the grant application for the IMMEDIATE trial. \n\nC. Site Identification, use of the SMART IRB Reliance agreement, and FWAs\nThe TIC CIRB noted that a critical next step will be site identification, as ideally, the grant application would include a) letters of support from each participating site that the site is willing to rely on the JHU TIC CIRB as the IRB of Record for this study and b) verification that each site is a signatory to the SMART IRB Reliance Agreement. The process for participating site onboarding to the SMART IRB Reliance agreement, through the assistance of the SMART IRB Ambassadors, was discussed. It was noted that one complication may include the fact that some local community hospital sites do not have a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) and having an FWA is a requirement for executing a joinder to sign onto the SMART IRB Agreement.  A link was provided to the study team to enable the team to cross-check the study sites for the IMMEDIATE trial and confirm which sites used in the original trial have an active FWA. \n\nD. Recommendations for a Comprehensive Consult \nThe following services might be offered by the JHU TIC CIRB if a comprehensive consultation is pursued\n1. Phase I [Prior to Grant Submission]:\na. Site on-boarding to the SMART IRB Reliance Agreement. Once study sites have been selected, the JHU TIC CIRB will share the list of participating sites with the SMART IRB Ambassador team [Harvard] to ensure the Ambassadors prioritize onboarding of the identified sites to the SMART IRB Reliance Agreement. These Ambassadors are dedicated to providing step-by-step support for the joinder process. For any identified sites that do not yet have an FWA, the JHU TIC CIRB can provide assistance/instructions for securing an FWA prior to signing the SMART agreement. \nb. Provision of template letter of support participating sites can sign to confirm they have signed onto the SMART Reliance Agreement, are willing to use the agreement as the basis for reliance and are willing to rely on the JHU TIC CIRB [for inclusion with the grant application]. \nc. Review of the grant description outlining the planned use of the JHU TIC CIRB, including provision of a full description of the JHU TIC CIRB's capacity to serve as a single IRB, assistance with the development of the communication plan for working with participating sites and provision of a letter of support indicating the JHU TIC CIRB's willingness to serve as the single IRB for this study. \nd. Review and feedback of preliminary drafts of the community consultation plan and development of a plan for incorporating local participating site feedback in the review of the appropriateness of this plan.  \n\n2. Phase II [Prior to IRB Submission]:\na. Assistance with the development and preliminary review of the community consultation plan including development of a plan to engage local participating site designees in the provision of a "local review" of the planned community consultation activities and their appropriateness for the targeted local community.\nb. Preliminary review of the protocol to identify any regulatory concerns, including potential concerns with the planned consent process and the use of an LAR, where applicable and appropriate.	\N

During our consultation, the Utah TIC reviewed Trial Innovation Network CIRB processes and educated the investigator on the lead site's responsibilities when submitting a CIRB application through the Utah TIC. \n\nIt appears 4 of the 5 FWA's sent to the Utah TIC are not signed up to the SMART IRB Master Reliance Agreement. Dr. Bowen's team confirmed that these local site are equipped to handle human subjects over site locally. The Utah IRC is not able to start CIRB work on the project until it is funded; therefore, we recommend that the investigator and her team reach out to the sites that are not signed up on SMART and inform them about the necessity of signing the SMART IRB Master Reliance Agreement as well as registering on IREx portal.	\N
73	This study proposal is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if the use of\ntetrahydrobiopterin on Scleroderma-associated digital ulcers will result in prevention or improved outcomes of ulcers.\n\nStudy Design: Participants will be evaluated up to 14 days prior to randomization and will also be asked to keep a diary\nto document Raynaud attacks for 1 week. Participants will be randomized to receive study drug, BH4, or placebo and be\ngiven study drug to take home with them for self-administration. At each study visit, patient reported outcomes will be\ncollected. Wound care will also be done simultaneously at local wound care clinics.\n\nAfter discussions of the study design and study aims, the Utah TIC made the following recommendations:\n1. Refine definition for net digital ulcer burden and ulcer assessments\n2. Request assistance from CCTS for Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD) and wound care\n3. Provide amniotic membrane to participating sites in order to standardize wound care treatment\n4. Send survey to participants to record their outcomes more regularly\n5.

She would like to\nenhance the registry with images of the progression and/or healing of digital ulcers as well as the patient reported\noutcomes from the study. After discussions of how best to integrate the improvement of the existing database into\nthis study, the Utah TIC made the following recommendations:\n1. Export the design of the REDCap database\n2. Find and utilize a smartphone application to take photos of participants' wounds weekly\n\nBudget and Feasibility: Dr. Frech would like to enroll 30 participants over 6 sites. The budget and feasibility\nchallenges currently focus around obtaining and shipping drug to all participating sites. After discussions, the Utah\nTIC made the following recommendations:\n1. Ensure that the pharmacy used for the study drug can ship to all study sites\n2. Include the amniotic membrane into the budget so that treatment can be standardized to all sites\n3. Have the drug shipped as a powder and the patient will reconstitute it themselves\n4. Have the participant ship the study drug box with empty vials back to PI. This will ensure accurate drug\naccountability\n\nRegulatory and IND: Dr. Frech requested advice on submitting an IND for her study drug, BH4. The Utah TIC made\nthe following recommendations:\n1. Create a pre-IND application prior to submitting the IND for the study drug. This will allow the FDA to review the\nIND information and give feedback and advice prior to submission.\n2. Do not include the vitamin powder on the IND application for study drug\n3. Obtain a letter from the study drug sponsor, giving their authorization to cross-reference their drug IND\ninformation\n4.

211	Study 1: One proposed study is a Phase IIb, multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, 3-arm, clinical trial to assess the efficacy of anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, and G-CSF compared to prednisone for the treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis (Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score > 20).  Because of the difficulty in masking known effects of the treatment regimens, the study will not be blinded.  All subjects will receive standard care for treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis as described in recent guidelines endorsed by AASLD and AGA\n\nStudy 2: The second is an observational study of cohorts of patients with well-characterized AH, heavy drinking controls without liver dysfunction, and healthy volunteers;	f	\N	This proposal involves two studies, a Phase IIb randomized clinical trial and a prospective observational registry study.\n \n9 sites are planned to participate.\n \nThe grant is currently under review with anticipation of funding starting in June/July 2018. The protocols would likely be submitted for CIRB review in 2018 as well. Although the plan is to submit both trials concurrently for CIRB review, if the FDA wishes to see changes in the clinical trial protocol, it is possible the observational study would be submitted first.\n \nWhile this specific group of sites does not have an extensive experience working together it is felt there is adequate coordination across sites to help facilitate the CIRB review process.\n \nOne of the items we sought to verify as part of the consultation was the planned number of VA sites. It is my understanding that there will only be the 1 VA site for the Alcoholic hepatitis clinical and translational network data coordinating center study with another that plans on potentially recruiting some patients from a VA center.  There are no overall concerns for agreeing to provide CIRB services for these studies other than the fact that this would be another case for which we are not the only IRB [e.g. VA central IRB would be reviewing as well].	\N
213	The protocol for this pragmatic trial was in a near finished state and well designed.  It was suggested to the investigators that benefit would be gained in the areas of start-up, data quality, efficiency of file transfer, and metric tracking to promote recruitment with performance dashboards using the VISION EDC system.  It was noted that the phase 2 trial preceding TREAT-MS took upwards of a year to get sites activated and as such, use of the JHU 90-day start-up program will likely lead to increased performance and efficiency for the overall trial.  It was also suggested that the investigators pull data from completed MS trials whether NIH or industry funded  to serve as benchmarks for areas such recruitment and retention.   Additionally, the price for medications used for treatment are extremely high and because of this, prospective reimbursement assessment will be done to try and ensure that all patients entering the trial are covered regardless of their treatment allocation.  Patient reported outcomes are a crucial component of this trial with known calculation errors in previous iterations of TREAT-MS.  We have proposed using a mobile app, electronic EDC capturing of these data fields to automatically calculate the scales and improve the reliability and validity of their key outcomes.	f	\N	The investigators have already had discussions with the JHU IRB and JHU will be providing cIRB services for this study.

The importance of including different biologics in the same trial is illustrated by the ADACTA and AMPLE trials that compared biologic therapies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and provided useful data to help providers and patients choose among biologic therapies in adults. Because the anticipated difference in effect sizes between biologic agents in poly-JIA is small, adequately powering a trial to detect these differences is not feasible. However, the inclusion of multiple biologic therapies in the same trial will enable direct comparison of the biologic therapies in exploratory analyses.   The outcome measures include ACR Provisional Criteria for CID, ACR response criteria (ACR50), and Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-- a composite measure of disease activity, including physician and parent global assessments, active joint counts, and inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP).      The current randomization scheme is four treatment arms (1:1:1:1) of MTX alone or MTX plus CTZ, ABA, or TCZ.  Randomization will be stratified based on steroid use.  At three months, if ACR50 response is not achieved, the current protocol allows a treatment switch.  Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.      Current challenges with the study design include:    a.  Should we consider biologic monotherapy? Novel in pediatrics, may reduce side effects; may increase acceptability to families (1 shot v. 2 shots)    The feedback from the TIC was to make this decision based upon the science and weighing the risks and benefits of eliminating MTX compared to marginal acceptability gained by giving 1 shot v. 2 shots. In addition, the study investigator indicated that through surveys to the Childhood Arthritis & Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) sites, there was a preference for combination therapy by the other investigators.    b.  Should we consider earlier endpoints? Results at 12 months may be difficult to interpret with the current design (especially the treatment switching), an earlier endpoint could optimize data collection for patient trajectory analysis, and could be supplement with additional follow-up and data collection within the CARRA registry    While the timing on the endpoint was not fully explored at this initial consultation stage, the group did discuss exploring the selected endpoints.  The current primary endpoint is clinically inactive disease at 12 months as a binary variable (i.e., disease or no disease).  The team discussed whether or not this outcome measure can be used in a more summative way to better characterize different degrees of disease activity and lead to better statistical power.  The current design is also using the ACR50 response (50% reduction in joint involvement) and the JADAS, which provides grading of disease activity based on a 0-35 score; however, these other measures are currently in validation phases.  If this proposal moves forward to comprehensive consultation, these outcome measures will be further evaluated to identify the most sensitive outcome measure for this trial.    c.  Are blinded joint assessments really needed? (NIH requested blinded joint assessments but this could be a barrier to feasibility because it is harder for smaller sites to have another provider available to complete blinded joint assessments)    The need for blinded joint assessments should be driven by the standards for clinical research practices for pediatric rheumatology trials and was not specifically addressed by this team.  However, the barrier to feasibility may be addressed by focusing on recruiting sites at the larger CTSA institutions with sufficient providers available to accommodate the blinded assessments.     d.  A major challenge in the design is the option to switch treatment at 3 months.     The biostatistician for the TIC recommended considering a more innovative study design such as the sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART), or another adaptive intervention model to drop treatment arms rather than the treatment switching at Month 3 for non-responders.  If this proposal moves forward to comprehensive consultation, the biostatistician recommended that the study team set the clinical goals and then engage the resources of the TIC and the CTSA Bayesian design swat team at Vanderbilt to collaborate and review the pros and cons of various designs to assist this team in developing a design that answers their clinical question(s) in the most efficient manner possible.	f	\N	\N	\N

215	Working protocol was supplied by the investigator and only minor updates occurred during the initial consultation.  TIC expressed concern with the large workload for sites and the potential quality problems that could occur as a result.  Current design causes a budget feasibility issue as the majority of funds under the $500K cap are devoted to paying sites for large workload.  Only minor concern with language describing composite endpoint. \n\nReview from NICHD study section highlighted several issues with the submitted grant, including lack of innovation. At follow-up meeting 11-May-2018, TIC recommended change in focus of the project to achieve   a budget of <$500K per year, while still achieving clinically meaningful results. An additional strategy that could be considered is to increase budget to >$500K per year to support current scope, with notable change in study design to meet requirements for innovation. Preference from the TIC is for the former option given the low likelihood of award from NICHD for a budget >$500K per year.	t	\N	CIRB through Duke/Vanderbilt TIC recommended to leverage advantages of the CTSA program. 4 of the 6 targeted sites are affiliated with CTSA insitutions.

The PI is open to re-evaluating the protocol design, given the change in funding source, and is considering including the vascular sub-study (at 5 sites) in the current grant application. Overall budget will be determined based upon the final protocol design.\n\nOriginal submission:\nThe protocol was reviewed by the trial innovation center and there were no concerns with the protocol.  The study team was looking to reduce the enrollment from 1 year to 6 months.  The team had already applied for an IND exemption and there was some discussion about possibly implementing standards since this was an industry study - - the study PI followed up with AstraZeneca and noted that standard reporting was not necessary.  \n\nThe study team also noted that they were going to submit to the NIH a proposal for a vascular substudy (R01).  We discussed the possibility of the TIC collaborating on this submission, but the study PI noted it was a pretty straight forward submission and he was fine with completing it.	f	\N	Nov 2018 update: The team agrees that this project remains a good collaboration for CIRB.\n\nOriginal submission: The team reviewed the CIRB process with the team and agreed this would be a good collaboration.	Nov 2018 update: This study is no longer an industry-funded trial, so the CTSA-FDP can be used.\n\nOriginal submission: Since this is an industry study, the study team could not use the CTSA-FDP.   There were some discussions about possibly using the ACTA or a modified ACTA.  Since the goal is not to slow down start-up the decision was made to further explore this option, but not to implement this at this time for the study.

255	The initial design submitted includes a 2:1 randomization ratio (infliximab:prednisone) and was proposed as a non-inferiority trial.  Trial design discussion included the preferred use of a superiority design given no multi-centered clinical trials to date have been done to show that prednisone is efficacious in treating neurosarcoidosis.  For the sake of sample size it was discussed that a 1:1 ratio would increase power in this limited sample size population of patients provided equipoise exists and no practice tendencies lean toward us of infliximab over prednisone among the consortium members.\n\nAnother trial design was proposed in which 3 arms would be used in order to include a true "control" of no therapy after 4 weeks of prednisone use (up to date recommendation) in order to increase the anticipated effect size and therefore reduce sample size/increase power.  Due to ethical considerations, Dr. Aksamit does not believe this is a viable option as he and many of the members of his consortium believe in treating patients with prednisone for a minimum of 3 months with some extending to 6 or even 12 months.  \n\nYet another design discussed was a response adaptive design in which the randomization allocation would be dynamically altered to favor the more beneficial treatment ("play the winner" type approach).  With this design a higher ratio of patients would be randomized in the end to the best treatment promoting recruitment in a disease where consequence of failed therapy remains high.\n\nWith a seemingly finite number of patients available for this rare disease in the 9 site consortium, use of a safety and/or biomarker endpoint to power the trial was discussed as it may be the only outcome in which proper power can be obtained to detect a difference before moving into a larger phase 2B or phase 3 trial.\n\nThese study designs along with other recommendations outlined below will be discussed with the consortium members to determine how they wish to proceed.\n\nRecommendations:\n1.Determine what current practice looks like at the 9 sites for treatment of neurosarcoidosis in terms of dose and duration of prednisone and how often a switch is made to infliximab as well as frequency of use of infliximab from the start\n2. Confirm equipoise for proposed duration of treatment of prednisone vs infliximab\n3. Consider powering on a safety and/or biomarker endpoint which in turn is correlated with a clinical outcome rather than a  clinical outcome itself which may be underpowered even in a 1:1 superiority design\n4. Once deciding on basic elements of trial, draft the protocol with consortium to facilitate work in the comprehensive consult\n5. Consider using core labs in the areas of clinical and radiographic outcomes for central adjudication\n6.

293	During the topic specific discussions, 3 different study design were presented and discussed.  It was decided that "Early-ELI" was the most practical and feasible study design consisting of enrollment within 12 hours, a GCS range of 3-14, with a 6 hour infusion of sodium lactate and safety as the outcome of interest in a 3x3 design.\n\nStudy population: The large range of GCS values adds to the generalizability in studying the common form of TBI but introduces the potential for imbalance in safety outcomes.  The idea of adaptive randomization was initially discussed but may not be practical and needs to be further explored once other elements of study design are determined.  In place of adaptive randomization it was recommended that two different strata of GCS scores be enrolled simultaneously to their own 3x3 design to control for disease severity.\n\nSample size:  Recommendations include an adaptive trial design in which only patients in the treatment arm are enrolled to quickly achieve the maximum tolerated dose and then introduce randomization to begin preliminary study of efficacy and reduce the total number of patients needed.\n\nOutcome: Initial study design included hypernatremia, defined as sodium level >160 mmol/L on two successive hourly readings, as a stopping rule for failing a dose.  It was recommended that a safety outcome be used such as arrhythmia or bronchospasm to confirm a major negative clinical outcome rather than a signal that may or may not represent such a clinical outcome of interest.\n\nThese recommendations will be further discussed and refined during the comprehensive consult along with budget and CCC/DCC task allocation.	f	\N	\N	\N

435	Stats: Propensity Analysis to compare and pool the registry data with the randomized data. \nFeedback from Dr. Rick Thompson:\nOverall the analytical plan, and the power analyses look sound. I have a few suggestions and comments. \n\n1)\tAs mention during the phone conference, it would be helpful to state in the grant that a numerically larger 12m-CD-TLR rate in the non-stent arm versus the stent arm necessarily implies non-inferiority of the non-stent intervention, prior to performing the Farrington-Manning non-inferiority test. This of course does not preclude the use of a superiority test of the 12m-CD-TLR rate in the non-stent to stent arm. However, if no formal non-inferiority test is needed, then it might be worth considering if a superiority test can be performed with a two-sided alpha = 0.05, rather than a two-sided alpha = 0.025. (I don't have a definite answer to this question). \n2)\tThe investigators propose using intention-to-treat (ITT) in the primary analysis. However, how is ITT defined for this trial? For example, how will a patient be handled who is randomized, but found to not meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria post-randomization? \n3)\tThe investigators propose to use the log-rank test for the time-to-CD-TLR analysis. I would propose that they also consider the Cox regression model for this analysis as well so they can control for any imbalances in the baseline covariates. \n4)\tThe investigators state that the t-test will be used for group comparisons of the continuous variables, but will use the Wilcoxon test if appropriate. It might be worth so discussion of how the investigators plan to determine to use the t-test versus the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. \n\n\nFeedback from Dr. Theo Cohen:\n\n1.\tConsider 1:1 randomization instead of 2:1 since it will result in a smaller sample size.\n2.\tGenerally for non-inferiority trials it is considered anti-conservative to perform the primary analysis on the ITT population.  I suggest performing the primary analysis on the mITT or per protocol populations instead	f	\N	\N	\N

32	The PRoMPT BOLUS study is a pragmatic, two-arm, randomized controlled trial comparing fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (intervention arm) and normal saline (control arm) in children with septic shock.  The study will be conducted in two phases, a pilot to assess feasibility and the main study to compare effectiveness.  The main ("parent") study would include 18 sites within the PECARN network, 16 of which are CTSA sites, and will enroll 8,800 patients over 4 years. The pilot phase will focus on addressing the following study aims: (1) To demonstrate separation in study fluids for pediatric septic shock patients randomized to normal saline or lactated Ringer's resuscitation using a pragmatic study design, (2) to determine the proportion of eligible pediatric patients enrolled into a pragmatic trial of fluid resuscitation, and (3) to demonstrate ethical, clinical, and parental acceptability of Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC). \n\nSince this consultation, the investigators have obtained local funding and will begin the pilot study without extramural support, at a single institution.  This study is anticipated to be completed in several months.  This has been the main reason for the prolonged period between the initial consultation and the final recommendations for support from the Trial Innovation Network.  \n\nThe aims of the parent trial are to (1) test the hypothesis that fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's will reduce hospital mortality by at least 1% compared to fluid resuscitation with normal saline in pediatric septic shock and (2) to monitor the safety of lactated Ringer's versus normal saline in routine clinical practice.\n\nPlease see Attachment 5 - Study Design, Parent Trial\n\nOriginal Eligibility Criteria:\nInclusion:\n1. Patients between the ages of 6 months and < 18 years old\n2. Clinical concern for suspected septic shock\n   a. Order for parenteral antibiotics for suspected infection AND\n   b. Administration of at least 20 mL/kg IV/IO fluid resuscitation\n3. Additional fluid deemed likely to be necessary to treat poor perfusion, defined as either hypotension for age or abnormal capillary refill (clinician judgement)\n\nExclusion:\n1. Receipt of >40 mL/kg IV/IO fluid prior to randomization\n2. Transfer from an outside facility where volume of crystalloid fluid administration cannot be determined (i.e., receipt of >40 mL/kg IV/IO fluid cannot be rejected)\n3. Clinician judgement that it is not safe to administer either NS or LR (e.g., presence of severe hyperkalemia or intracranial hypertension)\n4. Parents/guardians or subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, may be non-adherent with study schedules or procedures\n\nOnce enrolled, participants will be randomized to receive either 0.9% normal saline or lactated Ringer's.  All participants will receive fluid until 11:59 pm of the next calendar day and will be assessed at hospital discharge or at 90 days from study enrollment, whichever comes first.\n\nPROTOCOL REFINEMENT:\nChallenge: Perform screening, eligibility assessment, and enrollment without a study team.  Treating physicians would review the inclusion and exclusion criteria to assess and enroll participants\n\nDiscussion Summary: Study screening and enrollment are tasks typically performed by a research coordinator, or some other member of the study team.  The treating physician may assess the participant, but may then defer to the study team to ensure all eligibility criteria is met.  During the discussion, each inclusion and exclusion criteria was reviewed.\n\nRecommendations: \n1. Keep all inclusion and exclusion criteria to a minimum\n2. Consider removing all exclusion criteria and/or switching them to inclusion criteria. By removing exclusions, the eligibility has become pragmatic:\n   a. Exclusion criteria #4 becomes an inclusion criteria: Receipt of < 40  mL/kg IV/ IO fluid prior to randomization\n   b. Exclusion criteria # 3 becomes an inclusion criteria: In the clinician's judgement, it is safe to administer NS or LR (no signs of hyperkalemia or increased ICP)\n\nInnovation: Pragmatic eligibility criteria. Normally, all patients meeting inclusion criteria are entered into the study EDC, and exclusion criteria are recorded.  This facilitates later alterations of the exclusion criteria, but requires explicit data collection about each exclusion criterion.  Reduce number of criteria, but shift into inclusion criteria makes it unnecessary to have inclusion and exclusion data collection in the EDC.  \n\nChallenge: How should treatment allocation and randomizations be concealed?\n\nDiscussion Summary: The discussion centered on when participants should be randomized since the treating clinicians will not be blinded.  One idea is to randomize participants prior to enrollment.  For example, on odd days of the month, participants will be randomized to receive lactated ringers, which on even days, participants would receive normal saline.  Another idea was to randomize participants after enrollment.  To do this, a system must be in place that would allow fast & easy enrollment and randomization on the part of the physician.  Electronic systems involving particular website, access codes, and login IDs can be problematic and prolonged for a physician in the midst of caring for a trauma patient.  Therefore, a simple envelope system was proposed.  Envelopes containing randomization information would be created and numbered sequentially.  The envelopes would be available to the ED physicians. The enrolling physician would take an envelope and simply follow the instructions inside.  The act of opening the envelope would enroll the participant and the instructions would dictate which treatment arm.  A protocol violation would occur if the envelope was opened, but the instructions were not followed.  The data coordinating center would have the means to monitor and create the randomization envelopes.\n\nRecommendations: It was recommended that the study use an envelope system as discussed to enroll and randomize the participants.  A physician would identify a potential participant, select the next envelope from a group of sequentially numbered envelopes, open the envelope (which would enroll the participant) and follow the instructions for the type of fluid to be administered.  \n\nInnovation:  Pragmatic randomization. While envelope randomization is clearly an old technology, and we almost always use more sophisticated systems, in a pragmatic trial of this type (with no research team involved during enrollment and randomization), reverting to this old technology results in a more efficient workflow. \n\nChallenge: Outcome Selection\n\nDiscussion Summary: Large pragmatic trials require endpoints that are simple, unbiased, objective, and unambiguous.  Therefore, Dr. Weiss has selected mortality as the study's primary outcome.  After reviewing the reasons for selecting this outcome in further detail, the group was in agreement with Dr. Weiss.\n\nRecommendation: Mortality should remain the primary outcome for the study\n\nChallenge: Should the study population be enriched with a younger age population or cancer patients?\nDiscussion Summary: Bayesian-type monitoring of pre-specified subgroups may demonstrate a higher probability of differential outcome related to LR vs NS.\n\nRecommendations: To not enrich the study population as this hinders generalizability and also the cancer patients may have documented limitations of support in place.	t	\N	Challenge: Requesting feedback on the current EFIC plan\n\nDiscussion Summary: Dr. Ann Johnson, associate director of the University of Utah IRB, Dr. Jill Baren, physician and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Dixie Thompson, clinical research manager of the University of Utah's CCTS, and Jill Jannsen, director of Vanderbilt University Clinical Trials Center, joined this discussion via phone.  Dr. Balamuth reminded the group that they will be using exception from informed consent (EFIC) for this trial given the extremely short therapeutic window of 15 minutes.  The requirements for EFIC were reviewed.  The group began by discussing the requirement to obtain informed consent after enrollment.  Dr. Johnson reviewed the FDA requirement, which directs the study team to obtain informed consent as soon as is feasible and to document that information about the study was given to the parent or LAR.  The easiest way to capture this is to have an informed consent document signed. The discussion then shifts to the process of community consultation.  Dr. Weiss would like to use two ED/PICU focus groups, a survey to the community, an internet based communication, and social media.  Dr. Johnson suggests centralizing the community consultation process so that it may not be necessary to have focus groups at each site.  Dixie Thompson suggested using the CTSA Hub engagement resources assist with the community consultation.  It is unclear at this point, if each site in the proposed list of sites has a CTSA Hub resource.  Jill Janssen offered to see if the recruitment innovation center (RIC) could assist with the surveying.  Dr. Weiss presented the plan for public disclosure for the group's review.  The plan will include posters, flyers, brochures in the ED/PICU, Internet communications, internal communication to providers, and letters to referring physicians in appropriate subspecialties.  The group was in agreement with this plan.  The timely approach for the option to withdraw was also discussed.  Dr. Weiss' current plan would approach the family or LAR on the next business day.  Dr. Baren suggested approaching as soon as feasibly possible.  Patients would also be given the option to opt out prior to the start of the trial.  After public disclosure, those who wish to opt out would be given a medic alert bracelet to notify any clinician of their decision.  The group expressed agreement with this plan.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Approach family or LAR for written informed consent & the option to withdraw when feasibly possible\n2. Utilize the CTSA Hub resource and/or the RIC for assistance with the community consultation\n3. Ensure CTSA resources are trained & provided guidance on what constitutes meaningful community consultation\n4. Continue with current public disclosure plan\n5. Continue with current opt out plan	Challenge: Who should be managing the standard agreements?\n\nDiscussion Summary: The federal demonstration project (FDP) has standard agreements that can be utilized.  \n\nRecommendations: Utilize the FDP standard agreements.

425	\N	f	\N	The SPARK investigator, Dr. Wunderink, explained he seeks a Central IRB that is willing to work with the novelty and unconventional nature of their platform studies. The Northwestern University IRB had deferred the study due to its complexity.  The PI asked that the TIN provide a budget for CIRB services. He provided details about the length and complexity of the platform studies. There would be two big protocols ("study platforms") in the first year and then multiple modifications for each in the following years that would entail adding and/or dropping treatment arms. The PI explained that major modifications to the platform are open-ended based on the number of drugs, number of sites, number of protocol changes, and other discrete actions within a study based on study findings. \n\nThe Hopkins/Tufts TIC explained to the PI that each major modification would need to be submitted as a new study and that CIRB coordination will require a personnel team.  The PI understood and aims to increase funding through industry funding in later years.  \n\nIn a follow-up call, the Hopkins/Tufts TIC provided the PI a budget for both JHM IRB direct costs and for CIRB coordination costs which accounts for the two platforms, one major modification to each in year 1 and two major modifications to each platform in year three (or year two depending). \n\nThe CIRB Coordination component will be an additional team that works closely with the JHM CIRB and facilitates on-boarding of participating sites for CIRB approval when a study utilizes the JHM IRB as the central IRB of record. The CIRB coordination team is a specialized resource with combined knowledge of central IRB processes and requirements as well as project management practices. These coordination services were developed as part of the JHU-Tufts TIC and are implemented as an automatic service within JHU-TUFTS TIC regulatory activities when central IRB services are provided through the JHU-Tufts TIC. \n\nDr. Wunderink and team agreed to proceed with the Hopkins/Tufts TIC in providing CIRB services and coordination.	\N
114	Dr. Bazarian is proposing to set-up a consortia of concussion clinics within the CTSA network.  In doing so, a more complete assessment of the range of clinical practices currently surrounding diagnoses, treatments, and associated outcomes with concussion will able to be evaluated.  The current landscape of these practices is wide and as such it is crucial that Dr. Bazarian utilizes his own concussion clinic and perhaps a few select others from CTSAs to better inform the practices to determine which ones represent a majority of the range that exists thereby allowing a more focused approach to trial design and data reporting structure.  \n\nAs such it was recommended to Dr. Bazarian before moving to the comprehensive, that he utilize his local CTSA resources to survey the existing data at the concussion clinic at Rochester.  From this inspection Dr. Bazarian was able to provide a table of assessments that begins to capture some of the range of practices that can be seen even in his own local clinic.  It was also suggested that he used this time to survey some of the CTSA sites to obtain contact information for their respective concussion clinics and assess interest from his potential collaborators.  This effort resulted in a list of nearly 30 CTSA concussion clinics that expressed interest in being a part of this consortia.  The plan as we move into the comprehensive consult is to use the momentum gained from this outreach to involve some key opinion leaders from this group to play an active role in the shaping of this proposal.\n\nSome other recommendations/focus areas for the comprehensive consult include:\n\n- EHR cohort discovery to gain a better understanding of the number of sites needed\n-perform a similar data inspection to what Dr. Bazarian did at rochester and his clinic at a few other centers to better inform the design and sample size calculations\n-think about ways in which we can leverage similar EHR platforms (namely EPIC) to extract data directly from the electronic medical record to compare to conventional prospective entering of data by study teams into a cloud based EDC system\n-Survey anticipated sites to determine who has the capability to collect various biomarkers/imaging as part of regular practice to expand the domains of investigation at a minimal added expense\n-Assess the current 50+ factors being looked at for potential interrelatedness in hopes of trimming down the list to a more manageable databank	f	\N	\N	\N
321	(1) Site capacity for MAT therapy: The consult team suggested that the investigators utilize year 1 of the project to develop a list of outpatient providers. In addition, the investigators should discuss the following in the grant: site variability contributes to generalizability; describe the starting capabilities at each site and the feasibility of the collaborative care team approach at each site; include a description of a site-specific analysis and the advantages of site variance.\n\n(2) The investigators stated that subjects will be surveyed at beginning and at end to measure sustainability. Outcomes will be measured via combined phone survey and claims utilization data to avoid observer bias. The consult team suggested that the investigators include in the grant application that participation in the study will provide subjects access to medications that can be difficult to acquire at or near the time of discharge. The investigators described that the claims databases are different across the 3 sites. The consult team suggested imputing outcomes based on the UCLA and UNM data that it may be worthwhile to capture pilot data to show feasibility of this data collection method, even if the numbers are small. The investigators will ask the UNM DCC if preliminary data exists. \n\n(3) How does the TIC fit in? The investigators see the TIC as supporting oversight of network sites, implementing support, creating efficiencies, all allowing for improved allocation of resources and support of objectives. More discussion is needed regarding feasibility and budget allocation.\n\n(4) Safety Assessments: The investigators described concerns regarding communication pathways between subjects and care teams and concerns of overdose between discharge and initiation of outpatient therapy. The consult team suggested that the investigators review the NIH scenarios describing what is research and determine if the design fits into a healthcare delivery paradigm to bolster the argument versus describing the project as an organizational change that is impactful but isn't exposing patients to various treatments. The consult team suggested that the investigators describe in the grant how the communication pathway with the usual care team and how the intervention will impact the usual care relationship.\n\n(5) How long is reasonable to spend on adapting and implementing the CCT intervention? The consult team suggested that the investigators utilize year 1 of funding to establish and calibrate the teams at each of the three sites. Calibration should include case discussions with comparison of management strategies with a plan to measure fidelity, assess key skills, and identify areas of variability. The consult team agreed that 1 year for this task is reasonable and that the investigators should describe in the grant application how this task will be completed in year 1 with defined milestones and a contingency plan if more time is needed. This time could also be utilized to obtain an estimate of recruitment.\n\n(6) Data collection and management: UNM will serve as the DCC. The consult team suggested that the best way to organize the CCC/DCC relationship is around a statistical analysis plan (SAP). Year 1 milestones could include developing the initial drafts of the SAP, data dictionary, case report form, and data integrity/monitoring plan. The consult team counseled that de-identified data sets should only be provided to the local sites or externally after completion of a priori analyses to prevent premature ancillary analyses.	f	\N	The investigators have decided to utilize the Cedars-Sinai IRB as the cIRB.\n\nThe investigators asked the consult team when it would be appropriate to submit for initial cIRB review and approval. The consult team agreed that initial submission could occur upon funding with modification/amendment as needed after the year 1 calibration period. However, the investigators raised the concern that the intervention may not be appropriately refined for IRB review until after year 1.	The FDP agreement was shared with the investigators. All three sites are CTSA sites and 2/3 have already agreed to utilize the FDP.

159	Dr. Zadeh and team propose a randomized, non-blinded, parallel-group, clinical trial comparing the experimental non-invasive evaluation and management strategy to the current strategy.  The study population will include patients 18 years and older with stable angina pectoris or equivalent angina symptoms who have been referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of CHD. These patients will be evaluated/tested by physicians who will view the probability and severity of CHD sufficiently high to warrant invasive evaluation (American Heart Association /American College of Cardiology, AHA/ACC class I or II an indication for invasive coronary angiography). Exclusion criteria: prior anaphylactic reaction to iodine contrast; prior Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); severe congestive heart failure (New York Hearth Association, NYHA class IV); suspected or recent (within 6 months) Acute Coronary Syndrome, ACS; planned major surgery (necessitating interruption of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy, DAPT). \nThe Investigator proposes a 1:1 randomization to the two management strategies using a computer generated permuted block design and stratified by site. Patients randomized to the experimental strategy will undergo coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) instead of cardiac catheterization for assessment of their coronary anatomy. CTA images will be evaluated by the clinical team at each study site. Of central importance, will be assessment for high risk coronary anatomy, defined as the presence of left main, three-vessel, or two vessel coronary artery disease with involvement of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Only 25% of patients had high risk anatomy by CTA in the CORE320 study with a similar patient population as in CINEMA. If present, the patient will be referred to a heart team, consisting of noninvasive and invasive cardiologists, as well as cardiothoracic surgeons, for consideration of coronary artery revascularization. While not mandated, cardiac catheterization and invasive coronary angiography will be performed in most cases at this time. If no high-risk anatomy is present, patients will be assigned to an initial trial of medical therapy unless there is 15% myocardial ischemia on provocative testing, class IV angina, or reduced left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction less than 40%). If one of these criteria is present, patients will be referred to a heart team for consideration of coronary artery revascularization.\nPatients randomized to the invasive strategy will undergo cardiac catheterization and invasive coronary angiography as planned. Angiography results will be evaluated by the clinical team at the study site and management, including the decision whether to proceed with coronary artery revascularization, will be implemented according to local practice. All study sites will be strongly encouraged to adhere to current practice guidelines. \nThe proposed enrollment estimate is 4,706 subjects/65 sites; ~2-5 patients per site per month which will dictate the number of sites needed.\n\n\nAssessment: \nCINEMA's first protocol was reviewed; there were no issues identified with the design of this study. The Investigator needs to articulate medical care adherence program with equipoise for both arms. A total of 4,706 subjects need to be recruited; therefore, the rate at which these patients occur at the target sites is needed. Also, as the design starts with equipoise at the point of recruitment, we recommend the Investigators consider running the study faster; this will result in needing fewer sites, if the recruitment yield is higher.  Most patients will be seen by cardiologists who will then make determinations whether patients need cardiac catheterization.  In order to achieve a higher recruitment rate, standard messaging strategies to the patients as well as physicians will need to be developed. Having a unified voice from persons making decisions is key. Once a patient has been referred to a surgeon for a procedure, it will be difficult to change the assigned pathway; the angiographer is not going to double guess the evaluation of the referring physician and the referring physician is not going to change his/her referral pathway. This will require training practitioners at the sites.\n\nRecommendations/suggestions: \n•\tBench mark data for overview of CINEMA endpoints vs. traditional endpoints \n•\tFoster agreement between cores (JHU CT core laboratory and possible angiography core lab)\n•\tInvestigator needs to work on version #2 of his protocol \n•\tInvestigator needs to compile a list of the approached sites, the list should include attained response (positive, negative, etc.)\n•\tInstigator should build a CINEMA Executive Committee, identify other leaders in the cardiovascular field (the investigator need to engage leaders, listen to concerns and input)\n•\tInvestigator should rework their study design schema (confirm and add percentages through the diagram)  \n•\tInvestigator should consider having contingency early stopping rules for success that balance out the contingency futility rules, this would yield a broader degree of precision\n\nRecommendations for Comprehensive Consult:\n•\tWe recommend the investigator use the point of view and expertise of interventionalists to create a list of practice management, patient flow, site specific characteristics that will create barriers to robust enrollment (this list should be provided to the Recruitment Innovation Center-RIC during the comprehensive consultation)\n•\tCentral IRB planning is needed to ensure appropriate resources are available and to ensure multisite coordination plans include adequate human subjects protections \n•\tFurther discussion is needed to review CINEMA's study design\n     o\tBench mark data for overview of CINEMA endpoints vs. traditional endpoints \n     o\tDiscussion on Aim 3; Cost Analysis\n•\tEHR Cohort Discovery is needed \n     o\tRun Electronic Phenotype; rate at which these patients occur at sites\n•\tFurther discussion is needed on CINEMA's Statistical Analysis\n     o\tJHU TIC will review/redo power analysis \n     o\tExplore superiority and non-inferiority approach\n     o\tFeasibility of generating simulations of the composite scores \n•\tFurther discussion is needed on adherence/medical management  \n     o\tThe medical therapy needs to be further discussed\n     o\tAdherence strategies need to be developed \n     o\tHealth care delivery and institutional engagement needs further discussion\n•\tStudio Engagement: Studio geared to patients and physicians/providers is recommended \n•\tTo achieve recruitment goals physician education/training tools are needed\n     o\tConsenting methods (video consenting could be explored as an option)\n     o\tPhysician and patient messaging needs to be developed \n•\tFurther discussion is needed on designing CINEMA's Virtual Core \n     o\tFoster agreement between cores (JHU CT core laboratory and possible angiography core lab)\n•\tCINEMA's budget needs to be discussed\n     o\tPRA review and DCC/CCC roles	f	\N	\N	\N

420	Reactive Prevention Study Design\nThis would be considered a modified intention to treat design. This is harder to execute, however, gathering preliminary data on the combined outcomes is necessary; hold some clinician and patient focus groups/workshops to receive feedback on how to weight the different elements you are combining. Dr. Harry Selker and Dr. Theo Cohen at Tufts CTSA have experience in modified intention to treat design. \n \nOpen Label Study vs Blinded Study Design\nThe study PIs have concerns regarding the expense of a double dummy/placebo design regarding pharmacy complexity and cost. \n\nInterpretation of results would be different if open label vs. randomized placebo controlled study; is it possible to obtain this same information from a retrospective study that you would get from a prospective open label study?\n  \nPro - An open label study would allow you to obtain better data to develop your endpoints and have a larger number of patients, so generalizability will be greater.\nCon - The assignment of patients is not ruled by randomization and the assumption will be that you will have some biases; you could mitigate this by having wide inclusion criteria in the registry and then making a transition point to double dummy placebo strategy.\nConsider an interrogation of the cancer network databases for these potential study patients to state what you know;  even the absence of data will be a good rationale for doing the study. \n\nStatistics\nConsider a hierarchical endpoint with components that all have clinical relevance to the patient; consider quality of life as the tie breaker.\n \nThe key is to find out what is most important to patients and have an adequately powered study to meet the endpoint preferably with a smaller designed study. \n\nWith the development of a big registry, then you raise the possibility of having a prediction model that could have some clinical utility in developing a prediction model. Perhaps this could be done in the trial's control group or with another subgroup from the registry. This could be an added value to the study and worth including in the larger grant. This could become part of a sensitivity analysis in the primary aim to test whether or not the groups are as balanced as predicted from randomization.\n\nNetwork Development\nIn developing a network, ensure that the division of responsibility is clear to all. A Task Allocation grid helps to determine all aspects of the trial prior to study start as to which team (CCC/DCC/Core Lab) will do which responsibilities. The study PIs should discuss with their potential partners (DCRI, Alliance, JHU/Tufts TIC, Tufts CTSA) the possibility of different roles and what each group would be willing to do. \nThere was a discussion regarding the transition of the patients from oncology to cardiology to titrate medications:\n•\tConsider a more detailed protocol section regarding titration of medications based on BP, lab, etc. in the protocol and build a system into the EDC to help study teams titrate the medications. \n•\tConsider a core lab to help with a real time consult to assist study teams with drug titration. Make it a non-clinical burden on the oncologist\no\tConsider a clinical help line 24/7 to have an expert on the other end of the phone to help with titration. \n•\tThe study PIs decided to write a protocol draft to operationalize the participant details and cost details.\n\nWrap-Up\nOver the course of the initial consultation, the study PIs decided to revise the direction of this study. Originally, they planned for 20 sites and 2,800 participants, however, this was reduced to 3 sites with a 30-50 participant target enrollment. The study's new primary goal will be to test screening strategies and ascertain screening feasibility; and determine how many people they can identify with cardiotoxicity. Their grant will emphasize the recruitment innovations with the Vanderbilt RIC (EHR-based cohort assessment, clinical systems optimization for screening).This is now an observational study and patients will have their medications and dosages tracked, but not randomized by the study. With a change in protocol direction, the PIs were advised to revisit their local CTSA team for additional planning and resources, and the initial consultation was concluded.	f	\N	\N	\N

37	The current study design requires a very large sample size given the endpoints of the study and estimated difference between groups.  The study also has a long treatment phase further impacting costs. The existing study design may be cost prohibitive in that the estimated initial budget is in the ballpark of $97M.  Given the high cost and relatively little human data on efficacy and safety, the TIC recommends the most appropriate next step for this research be a dose ranging study to determine the appropriate (lowest safest) dose for this drug in this patient population with a biomarker endpoint, with a shorter treatment period of six months and targeting approximately 30 sites and 500 subjects.  The budget for this study would be approximately $12M.	t	\N	\N	\N
156	Study Design Recommendations\nA preliminary review of the protocol and study design was made during the initial consultation. After reviewing the comments from NIH that Dr. Jelin received in response to his previous grant submission, it was recommended that some preparatory work was needed by Dr. Jelin before revisions could begin. It was advised that Dr. Jelin work with nephrologists to revise protocol aims and consider incorporating additional scientific innovation (e.g. predictive biomarkers for lung development) into the protocol. Potential new aims discussed were: Aim 1- lung function (safety/feasibility and short term to power the study) and Aim 2-time to peritoneal dialysis (survival for 6 months). Other outcomes measures were also discussed, including the need for follow-up on the number of patients who are transplanted to inform quality of life outcome measures. It was also recommended that Dr. Jelin consider including a senior PI with experience in securing funding on his grant. The funding mechanism and timeline for RAFT was also discussed and it was suggested that Dr. Jelin consider possibly submitting his study to a rare disease network instead of the intended R21 to NICHD.\n\nStatistical Recommendations:\n1.\tConsider pairing the expectant management group with subjects that are being enrolled into the treatment arm in order to ensure sufficient number of controls. It was also suggested to set the sample size for the study based on the number of subjects who receive the intervention and find either concurrent or historical controls matched based on demographic characteristics.  The sample size would be determined based on the width of the confidence interval for the primary outcome measure. We also discussed that the characteristics of controls  enrolled prospectively (and maybe retrospectively if available) can be compared to those who select to get the active treatment to support the assumption that there is no difference (medically) between eligible patients who do and do not get the treatment [since this is not-randomized this is the inherent assumption].\n\n2.\tPossibility of using an adaptive sequential design that would allow stopping for safety, futility or higher than expected efficacy. Based on the fact that the necessary number of infusions and potential adverse events of treatment are not well known, this could help inform study design and study procedures in real time as data is collected and analyzed. It was also suggested that it might be worthwhile considering a mechanism for modifying the parameters of the intervention or inclusion/exclusion criteria as data accumulate during the study.\n\n3.\tFraming as a pilot study.  A primary goal of said pilot would be to get an estimate of the intervention success rate (ex. start renal replacement) and a 95% confidence interval for that estimate;  That confidence interval could be compared to historical data (presumed rrt rate = 0%) and also to  the controls enrolled during the course of this study [also expected to be 0%]. The spirit being that this study would become less dependent on the # of controls enrolled to achieve study 'success', being that it seemed that this is more like a surgical intervention than a drug study so the standards for adoption are different (doesn't require FDA approval, only adoption by the community based on convincing outcome data).  The next study would have a larger sample size and focus on the long term outcomes.	\N	\N	IRB Recommendations:\nFor grant application:\n­\tThe Johns Hopkins University (JHU) IRB provided Dr. Jelin with template text about JHM IRB as a sIRB for inclusion in his grant application.\n­\tJHU IRB also provided a template letter of support he can provide to relying sites to ask that they confirm willingness to rely on the JHM IRB. \n­\tJHU IRB will also issue him a letter of support for his grant application but do not plan to do so until he has confirmed the funding announcement he will respond to. \n\nFor CIRB review:\n­\tDr. Jelin provided a planned site list. JHU IRB verified all sites have signed onto the SMART IRB agreement. \n­\tJHU IRB provided Dr. Jelin with sample Step 1 instructions for onboarding sites to the JHM Letter of Indemnification. The Step 1 instructions will be sent to relying sites by Dr. Jelin/his research coordinator if he is not TIN-supported or by Cindy if he is TIN-supported. \n­\tJHU IRB informed Dr. Jelin that he cannot amend his existing single-site protocol to make it a multi-site protocol under the existing JHM IRB approval. He will need to submit a new study for CIRB review, and create a new protocol using the NIH protocol template. He will also need to de-Hopkinize the consent form and create a new template consent. Dr. Jelin will work on these documents and send to JHU IRB for pre-review.	\N

Those ongoing studies would continue with the submissions/processes that were already established.  It is anticipated that there will be about 8 new studies with various number of sites.  As new studies are developed, they will submit each protocol onto the TIN proposal system.  VUMC CIRB agreed they could support these additional new studies.	\N

55	Priority #1: Assessment of Protocol/Study Design  A draft protocol was reviewed and discussed during this consult. The study design is an open-label 3 arm design using a Bayesian Adaptive Design for randomization (N = 300). As mentioned previously this study aims to determine which of three treatments has the greatest effect on slowing disease progression in ALS. Secondary aims are to determine the tolerability of the drug therapies and their effect on respiratory decline in ALS, and rates of decline using a patient-derived functional rating scale. In order to support the clinical trial design the Investigator will leverage existing initiatives to streamline patient engagement, regulatory oversight, recruitment, outcomes data collection, and results dissemination across all participating sites. The Investigator plans to utilize 3 large existing networks to help recruit participants (CReATe, GPC, and UC BRAID) and the NCATS SMART IRB model for central IRB review. He plans to use EHR-defined computable phenotypes for patient screening (where available), and compare this approach to traditional recruitment strategies in the clinic or via patient advocacy groups. He also plans to engage patients to participate in trial design, study conduct parameters, and dissemination of study results. The investigator's second aim is to determine if two repurposed cardia drugs, mexiletine and ranolazine, both with similar neuronal mechanisms of action (preventing nerve hyperexcitability) will slow disease progression or improve symptoms compared to placebo (standard of care) using a novel Bayesian Adaptive Design. The primary outcome will be change in disease progression by monthly measures of ALSFRS-R from enrollment to 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes are change in disease progression by monthly measures of PADL-ALS, the Patient Activity of Daily Living scale, change in forced vital capacity (FVC), and change in ALS Quality of Life Scale. The Investigator specifically requests that the TIC assist him with defining his secondary outcome measures for Aim1. The proposed treatment arms were discussed, in particular with regard to the standard of care for ALS patients and how it affects the proposed design. All treatment arms include those patients who are taking Rilutek, but only 65% of ALS patients will actually be taking this particular drug. Patients who opt against taking Rilutek cannot be excluded. Standard ALS trials patients can change medications, but unfortunately the Investigator has no control over this and so the design must account for variability in standard of care, as well as possible confounding effects of riluzole.     Recommendations/suggestions:   �\tIt is advisable that the Investigator review the inclusion and exclusion criteria regarding safety. For example, exclusion of participants who have had a recent MI could be considered. Also the Investigator should consider adding more safety information for the patients.   �\tPerhaps establishing a baseline effect of riluzole could be added to the design.    Recommendations for comprehensive consult:  �\tDevelop/refine a safety monitoring plan   �\tDevelop ways to engage patients regarding safety issues and acceptability  �\tAssist in defining secondary outcome measures for Aim 1, assess opportunities for innovations in engagement, recruitment, and data collection  o\tEHR-based recruitment versus traditional recruitment  o\tDevelop ALS outcome template to move data directly from EHR into REDCap versus traditional entry into REDCap  o\tThe use of video sessions with participants for follow-up visits to enhance retention    Priority #2: Assessment of Statistical Analysis Plan  Summary of the discussion or discussion points:      It is recommended that the primary outcome of interest (ALS Functional Rating Score-Revised) be collected every month for each enrolled patient. Outcome data can be used to determine efficacy and futility at pre-specified time points. In contrast, it is recommended that no stopping rules be based on adverse events. The development of the interim analysis can be informed by longitudinal analyses of the de-identified PRO-ACT data (https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT). An adaptive Bayesian design was suggested whereby 26-week data can be used to predict 52-week outcomes, thus allowing the previous results to determine and inform adjustments to the trial design as the study progresses. An adaptive design, where assignment into each arm is informed by collected data, can shorten the development process without compromising the safety and efficacy. This may be beneficial with a rare disease like ALS since little success in treatment breakthroughs have been observed in previous ALS clinical trials.     Recommendations/suggestions:   �\tUse the PRO-ACT data to assess the relationship between 6 month data and 12 month data in the outcomes of interest.  �\tConsider using the 13-week data to predict the 52-week data instead of data at 26 weeks, as there should be predictive value in the earlier results as well.  �\tPerform sensitivity analyses, using linear mixed regression models that control for within-person time trends, to handle missing data.      Recommendations for comprehensive consult:  �\tThe TIC Biostatistics Core can assist in exploring study designs other than Adaptive Bayesian designs.    �\tStudies using survival as the endpoint can also be investigated to compare endpoint efficiency.    Priority #3: Data Management and Data Capture System  The data management plan was reviewed as part of the consult. Subjects will be recruited through a number of means: using EMR computable phenotypes to create a list of possible candidates at each site; one-on-one recruitment during individual clinic visits; using patient advocacy group (MDA, ALSA) newsletters, or clinic lists; and using the CReATE Connect ALS patient registry. The Investigator proposes two data management approaches: REDCap only versus EHR-i2b2 and REDCap. For the first option, patient study data will be captured and managed directly in REDCap, while with the second approach, the Investigator will leverage the availability of ALS clinic data in EHR-i2b2 which he plans to import into REDCap. The outcomes from the two different approaches will be collected to determine which approach best reduces the burden on patients, caregivers, and health care providers. The Investigator also plans to implement a patient visit and adverse event monitoring system via a two-way web-based video or via telephone to reduce the burden of participation and ensure retention.  It was discussed that RedCap has a DDP (Dynamic Data Pull) component that can pull data from an EMR to RedCap in real time.  However, there is resistance at many hospitals to allow RedCap to access EPIC data, especially when this involves multiple institutions. The Investigator has identified 39 possible sites of which only half have EHR/i2b2. Feasibility of integrating EHR and RedCap could add a significant burden and cost to the trial team. In addition, data in i2b2 are de-identified and not real-time, meaning it is unlikely to be useful for trial data collection (as opposed to cohort identification).  Recommendations/suggestions:   �\tIt is suggested that a more traditional approach is still needed for data collection; using direct EHR integration would be a sub-study (trial within a trial).  �\tIt is recommended to analyze existing data to determine screen yield and enrollment rate of the two approaches. Also, compare census data from the existing population database (regarding how much data was captured).  Recommendations for comprehensive consult:  �\tAssist with surveying of all proposed sites to determine/confirm EHR/i2b2 capability.  �\tCompare functional assessment from the two approaches (EHR or traditional) - including missing data points and timeliness to data entry.	f	\N	This study team will leverage an existing relationship with the University of Miami IRB for the already established CREATE network sites, consisting of 13 institutions, with an additional 39 sites planned by the Investigator.  Rare Disease Clinical Research Network's (RDCRN) Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC), an NCATS supported program, will manage data for the 13 study sites and hopefully also an additional 39 sites that are expected.    The DMCC, at the University of South Florida, will coordinate data collection for the multicenter study and facilitate all IRB submissions on behalf of study sites.  Feedback received on a PCORI grant application was critical of the planned comparison of regulatory efficiency through work with multiple IRBs.  The study team agreed that in order to address PCORI's concerns the application needed to clearly identify how the existing infrastructure of the DMCC would be leveraged to facilitate central IRB review through the University of Miami.   Resistance of participating institutions to cede review in studies supported by the RDCRN in the past was described. Local full IRB reviews have been required by relying institutions in addition to a central IRB approval due to lack of familiarity of the relying sites with the local context review process. It was noted that the SMART IRB reliance agreement better defines the roles and responsibilities of the relying organizations and the reviewing IRB and should improve acceptability of use of a central IRB model. Although the TIC CIRB would not be providing the CIRB review services, it was noted that other aspects of the TIC CIRB process could be leveraged to help support the DMCC in its role. Specifically, the TIC CIRB could provide support in a) educating participating sites about the process for local context review, and b) helping to facilitate provision of local context information to the DMCC. Use of an educational arm of the TIC CIRB to support the infrastructure of the DMCC will help enable the DMCC to extend their capacity to include additional sites. Partnering with the University of Miami IRB could also provide an opportunity to test whether the use of educational interventions for improving understanding of IRB reliance models could improve operational efficiencies with CIRB review.    Recommendations for a comprehensive consult include:  Developing a CIRB model that would address PCORI review criticisms and allow testing of an operational hypothesis that could include:  -\tWorking with the DMCC and University of Miami IRB, implement TIC-generated training and support services for participating site onboarding.  -\tEvaluate whether the addition of limited TIC CIRB support, in a manner other than provision of direct review services, may minimize time and maximize efficiencies in a multicenter central IRB model.	\N

The objective was to help educate the principal investigator on central IRB topics that would translate to OSU IRB being the IRB of record.  OSU IRB staff were also invited to the discussion but were not in attendance.    During the call the following topics were reviewed: \n\n-\tRole of the central IRB, local site human protections programs and local IRBs;\n-\tCIRB review process, stakeholder role categories and responsibilities;\n-\tReliance agreements and electronic management systems;\n-\tGrant application additions - the single IRB plan; and\n-\tLessons learned by JHU so far regarding staffing needs, education, and planning for sites, communication and the overall project.\n\nIn addition to the above topics, emphasis was placed on communication with the OSU IRB to ensure plans are in place and that requirements are met.  Also emphasized was consideration for staffing to coordinate local site IRB documents to and from the OSU IRB document in collection, submission, and dissemination of approved documents.	\N

170	Dr. Crane is planning a prospective randomized controlled trial of the AVR device. Patients with UVD who meet the entry criteria will be enrolled and given the AVR device in addition to instructions on standard vestibular rehabilitation exercises. During a 1 week run-in period prior to randomization the participants will complete a static visual acuity task.  The purpose of this run-in period is to allow people the opportunity to get used to the equipment and also determine the stability of symptoms prior to therapy(DHI will be measured at enrollment and at the end of the week, a visual analog scale will be used daily). After the run-in period patients will be randomized to either a placebo or the AVR task.  As with the run-in period the DHI will be measured weekly and daily (when the subjects login) they will complete the visual analog scale and also report whether they did the standard vestibular rehabilitation exercises that day. The trial will persist for 4 weeks. At the end patients who were given the placebo task will be given the opportunity to do the AVR if they wish.\n\nRecommendations:\n•\tSTUDY POPULATION: Consider adding a second subgroup of ACUTE unilateral vestibulopathy (vestibular neuritis) patients, in addition to the CHRONIC unilateral vestibulopathy patients to improve generalizability of the study population and results. Plan for STRATIFIED randomization for these two groups. This is an opportunity for TRIAL INNOVATION by pairing diagnostic trial (NIDCD-sponsored AVERT trial using video-oculography for diagnosing acute vestibular neuritis and related vestibular disorders) with therapeutic trial (self-administered vestibular rehab trial).\n•\tSTUDY DESIGN: Patient-level randomization, 1:1 (intervention:placebo). There was agreement that a placebo comparison was most appropriate, given the novel and focused nature of the intervention (and lack of evidence on efficacy of specific sub-types of vestibular rehabilitation therapy. There was discussion about using a crossover design (in the placebo arm [crossover to self-administered rehab] or in both arms [crossover to standard 'live' vestibular rehab]); this is a topic for further focused discussion as part of a comprehensive consultation.\n•\tSTUDY INTERVENTION: There was agreement that a focused, vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation-oriented rehabilitation strategy was most appropriate given the following: (1) many vestibular rehabilitation studies have used an extensive, complex battery (adaptation plus compensatory plus  substitution plus postural control exercises plus reconditioning, etc.), so studying one subset of these in isolation is both innovative and important; (2), more complex interventions are unlikely to be self-administered by patients at home, so more complex interventions are not readily scalable; (3) the most important ingredient for a study population of acute and chronic unilateral vestibulopathy patients is likely to be VOR adaptation. There is a need for further discussion in comprehensive consultation regarding allowable co-interventions and how to monitor them (self-report, standard activity level scales, devices [fit bit], etc.).\n•\tMAXIMIZING ADHERENCE: Planned was a run-in period in which subjects who do not adhere are dropped from the study. We reviewed a prior study section critique about lack of follow-up in those who fail to adhere to the treatment, which would be relatively inexpensive. The main goal of the run-in dropouts was to avoid diluting the treatment effect, but this can be managed instead by using a per-protocol statistical analysis, rather than intention to treat, which would be appropriate for a Phase II trial. Consider instead eliminating the "run-in" period, randomizing all patients from the start, and using adherence as a target for a TRIAL INNOVATION by conducting a cluster-randomized, site-level meta-trial. For example, an escalating intervention to maximize adherence (e.g., email/text message reminder for 1 missed day; phone call reminder for 3 missed days; in person visit for those with technical problems) could be applied to half of the sites, randomly selected (or using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design). Further design considerations/logistics/budgeting would be part of a comprehensive review.\n•\tSTUDY OUTCOMES: More robust patient-centered outcomes are needed for the trial. This issue was raised in a prior study section critique. While DHI is a specific vestibular/balance measure, it is not a quality-of-life scale, per se, but rather a functional impairment scale. Consider both a general, well-established QOL scale (SF-36... or SF-12 or EuroQoL-5D if a shorter instrument is needed) and some validated scales from the PROMIS library relevant to vestibular. Additional instruments/outcome measures should include validated measures of falls and gait/balance function. If participant burden is a problem, some physiologic measures could possibly be dropped. Further discussion of this issue would be part of a comprehensive review.	t	\N	\N	\N

297	Original aim was to enroll 50,000 patients (women of reproductive age with different disabilities). With the aim to enroll 5,000 with cerebral palsy (CP) then 500 would potentially become pregnant, and 5,000 with spina bifida (SB) with another 500 SB becoming pregnant. Throughout the course of the consultation, it was advised to focus only on women with CP and SB, and narrow registry ambition only to 10,000 in this cohort and focus on the 1000 who will potentially become pregnant. Reduce the specific aims, by removing aim 2 and 5 as below:\nSpecific Aim 1: To develop on ongoing national prospective registry of reproductive age women (18-45) with physical and other disabilities.\nSpecific Aim 2: To quantify the pregnancy intentions and sexual and reproductive health behaviors and needs,\nincluding contraception and STD prevention, of reproductive age women with physical and other disabilities.\nSpecific Aim 3: To determine the incidence and correlates of a) pregnancy and b) selected maternal and perinatal\noutcomes in the cohort of reproductive age women with CP or SB.\nSpecific Aim 4: To describe women's perceived need for support systems and audit the adequacy of selected\nclinician practices during pregnancy and postpartum in women with CP or SB.\nSpecific Aim 5: To archive maternal and newborn (cord) blood from a subset of women with CP and SB in a dedicated biorepository for future funded ancillary investigations of genetic and epigenetic factors that may mediate transmission and severity of CP and SB.\n\nBy reducing the spec aims, first establish a registry that will consists of Tier 1 data collection, with the general purpose of improving the health care for women of child bearing age who have SB or CP.  The registry would be described as focused on child bearing age, so it would include issues of pregnancy, but could also include other health care issues for this age group of women, and would be set up to permit participants to be approached for specific Tier 2 research projects.  For this proposal, the Tier 2 research project would simply be to find out if any of them become pregnant during longitudinal follow up.  Infrastructure will need to be set-up to make the registry robust, such as devising a newsletter strategy to maintain retention, and then potentially working with the CP and SB patient organizations to identify areas of patient centered concerns.  This could lead to potential PCORI applications in the future, that might deal with any aspect of disability in this population, even beyond reproduction.  However, for this project, there would be baseline phenotypic information about their disability, permission to contact them regularly to inquire about their health and pregnancy related questions, and a communication network to preserve participant retention.  The main outcome would be pregnancy counts and extremely limited description of those pregnancies.  (As soon as a couple thousand Tier 1 participants have been recruited and the pregnancy counts increase, then it is advised to submit the next grant in order to get delivery records to analyze details). The timeline would be, the first year to finalize the publicity materials and mechanisms and to start the recruitment process through the CTSA consortium.  Subsequent years would be focused on enrollment, with attention to whether certain populations were not being adequately enrolled, which could lead to RIC assistance for reaching specific racial or ethnic groups, etc.  It is advised to have a conservative enrollment goal. For example, target 2,000 enrollments per year (1,000 with each condition).  When progress is made on the base R01, then apply for additional grants built on the existing robust registry, and include the more detailed questions.	t	\N	Utah TIC Executive Director reviewed CIRB processes with PI and recommends CIRB services for this project.

207	-RCT to study evaluation strategy using abdominal ultrasound (FAST) vs strategy without.\n-Planned participating site total: 6 (5 CTSA, 1 non-CTSA, all PECARN sites)\n-Planned sample size: 3,268\n-Recruitment Timeline: 3.5 years\n\n-Recommendation: Consider powering study to 90% (from 80%), increasing sample size, and adding 2-3 additional sites in order to finish recruitment in allotted timespan with additional patients.	t	\N	-The PI conducted a previous single-center pilot study at UC-Davis, which also acted as the local, single IRB. A waiver of informed consent was obtained for initial enrollment. The UC-Davis IRB also required that community consultation be done by the Investigator (even though EFIC was not required). Research staff were required to obtain written informed consent and assent (which was typically obtained later during the ED or hospital visit) for the follow-up portion of the study.\n\n-For the proposed trial, it is believed that a waiver of informed consent for initial enrollment and subsequent written informed consent for follow-up will be adequate and that EFIC will not be required.	\N
354	There were extensive discussions around what acute injury would be the most desirable for a pilot study trial to demonstrate mechanism engagement. Should the focus be on TBI patients or Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/Intracranial Hemorrhage patients in the phase 2a study?  She envision this 2a study as a proof of concept trial that will allow us to get PD endpoints in humans and show engagement of mechanism.\n\nDr. Van Eldik's pre-clinical data is in TBI. However, TBI patients are a difficult patient population to perform a trial in due to the variability of the disease among patients and the lack of clear radiographic endpoints available. Also, there is an aim to collect CSF at various time points, however, most TBI patients do not have External Ventricular Devices (EVDs). During the discussion, several experts in the field (Jian Wang, Lauren Sansing, Wendy Ziai) expressed their advice on ICH/SAH patients to be the focus. Upon further discussion, specifically ICH patients were recommended as a preferred patient populations since ICH produces edema in the brain tissue, and is easier to assess and alter, compared to the vascular changes of blood vessels associated with SAH. Additionally, about 30% of ICH patients receive an EVD.	f	\N	\N	\N
359	The protocol is available for review. However, it is not peer-reviewed. Study design and concepts planned for the protocol were reviewed and discussed during the "kick-off" call. No comprehensive consult is needed. This is an industry funded study with a tight deadline for study start up. \n\nRecommend moving forward independent of TIN support due to  the short time-frame and the following concerns: \n\n-Industry funded; therefore CIRB is not required\n-Protocol is not currently peer-reviewed\n-PI study start date summer 2019\n-Half of the participating sites are not CTSA sites.	f	\N	PI is interested in CIRB support. Seven of the fourteen sites are not signed up to SMART, and five of the seven sites do not have FWAs. Due to the fact that this is industry funded and the tight timelines that this will entail, the Utah TIC is not able to provide support for CIRB services. Also, CIRB is not required due to industry funding.	We briefly discussed the option of using the ACTA standard agreement with CDx Diagnostics, but because the PI's institution has already began negotiating a contract with the sponsor, standard agreement consultation was found to be unnecessary.

28	Following a 60 minute webinar with the principal investigator and his team to discuss the protocol design and statistical analysis, we have the below observations and comments: \nRecommendations: \n•\tFor the primary endpoint, all TIMI blood flow grades (not just TIMI 3) should be included in the analysis to show if successful reperfusion was achieved in all participants.\n•\tSecondary endpoints should be straightforward and clearly address the study hypothesis that RUC-4 will improve pre-PCI blood flow and reduce infarct size. Any additional measurements of interest can be collected (if not overly burdensome or complicated) and analyzed as exploratory endpoints.\n•\tThe inclusion of four treatment arms should be reviewed from a feasibility perspective.\n•\tInfarct size measured via MRI at 30 days may be an easier endpoint to assess than ejection fraction\n•\tThe Phase 2 should be a short study with short term follow up.\n•\tAn angiogram core lab and MRI core lab should be used.\n•\tA comprehensive data and safety monitoring plan is required.\n•\tThe hypothesis and design of the future Phase 3 study should be kept in mind when designing the Phase 2 study, as the Phase 2 results can and should inform the Phase 3 design. For example, individual endpoints in this Phase 2 study may be components of a composite Finkelstein-Schoenfeld endpoint for the future Phase 3 study.\n•\tPatient Reported Outcome measures around pain relief, injection site and QOL/Self-assessment were agreed as reasonable measurements. These should be kept as simple as possible and can provide preliminary data to inform the selection of more in-depth PRO measures for the Phase 3 study. Some favored questionnaires are the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (preferred over the Seattle) and the Minnesota Questionnaire. The PROMIS may not be very widely used. MAPIgroup.com is a useful repository of PRO Measures.\n•\tThe generalizability and ability to compare PRO's across groups and the presence of comorbidities should be considered. The precision of the measurement has to be suitable to be able to assess the expected effect. The investigator should review each question within a questionnaire to assess what relevant data required by clinicians and other stakeholders will be collected.\n•\tIn the event that private funding is secured for the entire Phase 2 trial, we recommend that this study undergoes peer-review.\n\nThe JHU-Tufts TIC supports a Comprehensive Consultation to work with the investigator to develop the study protocol, specifically the selection of the endpoints, development of the statistical analysis plan and a comprehensive data and safety monitoring plan. \n\nOther Comments: \n•\tIf successful, this trial could lead to a change in clinical practice by demonstrating improved outcomes as a result of immediate EMS administration of anti-platelet agents.\n•\tThere was no statistical analysis plan available as the endpoints have not been finalized. This will be developed with the investigator if a comprehensive consultation is approved.\n•\tThe investigator has consulted with numerous expert clinicians and biostatisticians from within his institution and across the CTSA network on the study design.\n•\tThe investigator continues to engage with FDA and NHLBI in the development of the RUC-4 clinical. The FDA approved in general the clinical plans for RUC-4 development at a pre-IND meeting in July 2016.	f	\N	JHU CIRB recommendations relating to participant recruitment and consenting strategies \n•\tWhether an approval for exception from informed consent (EFIC) is pursued with the FDA or not, the TIC CIRB recommends a comprehensive consult to include: CIRB review of consent plans and if required plans for community consult prior to CIRB submission.  The CIRB would collaborate with the investigator prior to CIRB submission to devise a consultation strategy or alternative plan for emergency department consenting.\n•\tBecause of the unique requirements related to community consultation, the TIC CIRB noted one item that would be considered is how to effectively solicit local feedback on the planned consultation activities. This is something that would be more fully explored in a comprehensive consultation.\n•\tFor the study grant application, the JHU/Tufts TIC CIRB can furnish a description of the CIRB and letter of support as the planned central IRB of record for the multi-institutional study.	\N
52	\N	f	\N	During our conversation, Dr. Trachtman requested additional information regarding support for Central IRB through the Trial Innovation Network.	\N
421	\N	f	\N	The Johns Hopkins/Tufts TIC considered the request for CIRB and determined that this study was not a good fit for CIRB services and coordination. First, the study is already open at several sites. To transfer the study to CIRB would require closing the protocol at the current sites and having the protocol be re-reviewed from the beginning at the Hopkins IRB. The study team was looking to increase the speed at which new sites opened. Transitioning to CIRB would not solve this issue. Second, CIRB is not a requirement for this study as funding was granted in July 2017.	\N

82	This study will be conducted at 3 CTSA sites, each site enrolling 20 sickle cell disease (SCD), 20 cystic fibrosis (CF), and 20 healthy age-matched controls. The new CPET approaches will be analyzed in terms of: 1) established indexes of health (e.g., body composition); 2) habitual physical activity, an emerging metric of child health; and 3) disease impact using standardized questionnaires and novel exercise-responsive gene expression signals in the circulating blood.  These children will be followed over a 3 year period.  In combination with healthy children as comparisons, the project will delineate the use of CPET biomarkers across a broad spectrum of pediatric health and disease. The study will take advantage of the grant cycle and study cohorts prospectively as participants grow and mature from Tanner 2-3 to Tanner 5, roughly a 3 year interval.	\N	\N	CIRB recommended through the Trial Innovation Network.	\N

399	\N	f	\N	The Utah Trial Innovation Center recommends providing CIRB services for this project. During our consultation, the Utah TIC reviewed Trial Innovation Network CIRB processes and educated the investigator on the lead site's responsibilities when submitting a CIRB application through the Utah TIC. \n\nAll sites have signed the SMART IRB agreement and 9/10 are registered with IREx.	\N
236	\N	f	\N	University of Alabama is the lead site and already has IRB approval. Site is under extreme pressure from industry sponsor to enroll in December 2017. The Utah CIRB Team has the following concerns:\n   - UAB wants to stay on their own local IRB approval and not transition to a CIRB. \n   - Allowing the lead site to remain on their local IRB approval deviates from the current Trial Innovation Network CIRB workflow. The lead site is an integral part of the CIRB TIN workflow and not having the lead site's participation in the CIRB has the potential to cause multiple disruptions resulting in CIRB delays. \n   - The PI needs about 6 additional sites - a potential mixture of community and academic centers. \n        -Of the three additional academic centers identified by the PI, the University of Florida has not signed on to the SMART IRB Exchange. This will cause delays in CIRB approval for this site.\n        -  PI needs about 3 additional community sites to meet his enrollment goal. If CIRB reliance agreements and assurances are not already established with these sites, this will cause a delay in CIRB approval.\n\nOverall, the Utah TIC feels that we cannot meet the investigators aggressive timelines for getting CIRB approval for all sites and respectfully declines CIRB assistance for this study.	1.\tContracts\na.\tIndustry Funding - University of Alabama already has a contract in place with Horizon which is not the Accelerated Clinical Trial Agreement (ACTA) so it is likely untenable to use the ACTA subcontract template.  \n\nb.\tFederal Funding - With Federal funding, ideally Trial Innovation Network projects would use the FDP CTSA Subaward Agreement.  However, since there will likely be a combination of both industry and federal funding subcontracting could become very complicated as neither the ACTA subcontract template nor the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) CTSA Subaward Agreement would meet their needs.  The TIC standard agreements group has not developed a template for a mix of both industry and federal funding.

243	Full protocol was supplied by the investigator as the team plans to begin the trial in February/March 2018.  No major concerns noted.  Protocol clearly came from a team with clinical trial experience.  A brief discussion surrounding the design of the primary endpoint composite took place to clarify the intention. The only noted concern was that the trial may be overpowered.  Submitting investigator was aware that power calculation was a very conservative estimate.  Sensitivity analysis on event rate was recommended by TIC Statistician.	f	\N	CIRB unnecessary as only 3 sites are needed and all are affiliated with Mayo Clinic and the CTSA.  IRB approval was already achieved prior to submission to the network.	Standard agreement services unnecessary as only 3 sites all affiliated with Mayo Clinic.
54	A formal protocol was not reviewed. An assessment of current study design, project timeline and feasibility was performed using the previously submitted grant application.  Since the proposed recruitment rate is very aggressive, it is recommended that the Investigator use cohort discovery to address / assess   this potential problem. Participant retention could also be a potential problem as a ~25-30% drop out rate is anticipated. This dropout rate could be attributed to many patient and disease factors, including withdraw from study due to drug related side effects.  Although side effects themselves are not of concern, the Investigator should consider providing additional information to participants about the type of potential side effects expected and the length of time these are expected to last. A thorough plan to assure adherence should be developed. Exclusion and inclusion criteria of this study were discussed. Diagnosis of diabetes is an exclusion criteria; however, individuals with levels between 6.5-6.9 mg/dl pre-diagnosis could still be included in the study.  The biological single outcome of metformin and how this is manifested in biomarkers and imaging was discussed with the Investigator. The Investigator discussed that to-date there are no real gold standard outcomes in measuring global cognitive change versus focal cognitive change in Alzheimer's.  However, biomarkers are stronger than neuropsychological changes using MRI to measure total brain volumes, and is a good clinical surrogate to find evidence of cerebrovascular disease. The Investigator is using MRI measurements as outcomes, and comparing them to cognitive assessments. With regards to the cognitive assessment, the issue of learning effect was discussed.  Although the learning effect is well established and accepted in this field, it was suggested that the Investigator considers adding a run-in period so that all participants start from the same base level.  Since the reviewers will most likely look at this trial as an explanatory trial, the Investigator should go for a clinically meaningful difference and build in sub analyses for a plausible difference.    Recommendations to Investigator:    �\tComplete analysis of brain volume from pilot data   �\tSpeak with industry contacts about placebo manufacturing   �\tThe Investigator was encouraged to initiate a discussion with NIA regarding TIN utilization  �\tThink about pooling data from other trials to judge changes in dose/response   �\tIf the Investigator chooses the comprehensive course and it is approved, then a detailed plan for DCC development with the TIC DCC should be undertaken and use of TIC eCRF be considered.        Recommendations for a Comprehensive Consult:    �\tEHR cohort discovery to identify number of sites needed to reach recruitment goal   �\tFurther background work on global vs focal change and correlation with global and focal brain volume measures  �\tAssist in the development of a budget  �\tFinding study sites (survey CTSA sites for target population)   �\tFinding a research pharmacy and assistant with procurement of drug and matching placebo (this will be a join effort Columbia, JHU-Tufts, and CTSA)  �\tAssist with cohort identification    The proposed statistical plan from his PAT application as well as the Investigator's 2013 grant application were reviewed and accessed.  The primary aim is to compare changes from baseline to 24 months.  The Investigator should consider adding in intermediate time point as well, i.e. measure the primary outcome between the currently proposed times of Baseline and Year 1, and between Year 1 and Year 2. This approach may also lead to less lost-to-follow-up since the subjects are contacted more frequently.  However, a more frequent cognitive function testing such as every 3 months would increase a potential bias due to the learning effect.  A possible solution could be to explore 'Run-in' times to help create a level playing field in patient familiarity with the outcome assessments.  It is recommended that the Investigator explores performing a longitudinal analysis for ADCS and Recall test (as it is a global measure for identifying AD/Dementia) for multiple domains. The Investigator should also consider including treatment by time interaction terms in the longitudinal regression analyses to compare group differences in trends over time Power analyses could be potentially performed on the expected differences in slopes by groups. Adherence to intervention was also discussed, and the Investigator should consider performing a sensitivity analyses to account for lost to follow-up data, which potentially consists of non-ignorable missingness.      An important effect modification that the Investigator should consider is a difference in treatment response by APOE genotype, since it is well known that APOE-e4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD (identifying amyloid in the brain). Younger people may have different effects. The Investigator should consider doing additional power analyses on subgroup differences. These power analyses could possibly be informed by the means and standard deviations from published studies. Since not all patients will stay in 1000 mg dose, it is not clear on how this will affect the results.  One possible solution is to consider dose modifications in the longitudinal regression model.        Issues Identified:   �\tCorrelation between biological to primary outcome (exploratory analyses on biomarker)  �\tInformative censoring: missingness/lost to follow-up that is 'not missing at random' could be a potential problem (i.e. the population health can decline fast, leading to missingness due to unmeasured declines in cognitive functioning).   �\tThe expected dropout rate is high at ~25-30%. The Investigator should consider ways to decease this lost to follow-up in the study design.   �\tIssues with intervention/testing: Not all patients will get MRIs. Only about ~50-60% would undergo MRI based on availability and willingness (i.e. patients need to lie down, claustrophobia could be a barrier, time commitment as the scans take 2-3 hours per patient), potentially leading to a loss of power in the secondary outcomes of brain measurements.  �\tPotential of unintentional crossover should be considered.   �\tLearning effect - a potential learning effect bias with repetition needs to be considered.         Recommendation for Comprehensive Consult:   �\tAs part of the comprehensive consult the JHU-Tufts TIC, the statistics group could replicate the simulations from the pilot study (to address issues of adherence, crossover, and event rate).  �\tStatistics group could perform power analyses of effect modifier to assess heterogeneity/homogeneity.  �\tFinally, the statistics group could help the Investigator refine the statistical analysis plan.	f	\N	\N	\N

382	○ With the potential of a 40% dropout rate and a differential dropout rate, there was a discussion around taking modified intention to treat approach with a run-in period so you don't end up with patients who cannot tolerate the drug. \n\t\t\t · Declare the run-in period post randomization. \n\t\t\t · Modify the primary analysis to include only those individuals who after one month were able to continue taking the drug. This helps with eliminating the 20% of patients who immediately will stop taking the drug due to side effects. The placebo group with apparent side effects drops out here too. By losing this 20% early on, you decrease the costs to this group\n\t\t\t · Then the 118 subjects per site enrollment starts at month one. \n\t\t\t·  Design an incentive program for this remaining group\n\t\t\t·  For those remaining from Day 31 to end of the study should be considered healthy and free of age-related comorbidities, since the exclusion criteria screens out other comorbidities.\nAnother suggestion:\n○ A run-in would make sense with a low dose betablocker for everyone to see who could tolerate drug prior to randomization. \n                        · Consider 25mg run-in prior to randomization to test tolerance and then start 50 mg at randomization or move to placebo arm;  \n                        · Contact with patient after 30 days will be a safety measure (check BP) and a retention measure (ensure they haven't lost interest).  \n○ ITT vs. mITT (modified intention to treat)\n                       · ITT assign those randomized to the beta blocker, then if they drop out, then assign them to the expected change. You wouldn't remove that bias so much and then do an on-treatment analysis secondarily.\n                        · mITT assign to randomized only those patients who remain on beta blocker after the 30 day run-in. This is more efficient with trial resources and will allow for better estimate of the possible treatment effect size. \n○ Let people know their eligibility baseline tests are in the "eligible" range, but be cautious about giving out baseline information related to the outcomes to the study participants. \n○ Inclusion/Exclusion:\n      · Consider adding orthostatic blood pressures;  \n      · Consider limits on the range for higher end of SBP at baseline as some will be in the placebo arm and consider the lower range  of 120 SPB as the lowest possible allowable range. \n      · Consider an EKG at baseline for inclusion/exclusion screening; Define what EKG results will result in exclusion. \n       ·Consider adding EKG "for cause" on ongoing basis. \n○ Confirm with NIA about their policy on independent DSMB	f	\N	\N	\N

146	Dr. Passman and team propose a prospective multicenter unblinded 1:1 randomized trial comparing continuous NOAC (novel oral anticoagulant drug) versus smartwatch-guided intermittent NOAC for lower risk patients with non-permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). Physicians will prescribe marketed NOACs, which currently include Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, and Edoxaban. The REACT AF subject population will consist of AF patients considered to be at a lower baseline risk of having a stroke, but in whom anticoagulation is still indicated under current guidelines. Only patients with a CHA2DS2-VASC score of 1- 4 (baseline stroke risk of 1.3 - 4% per year) will be eligible for this trial. Subjects enrolled will be limited to those with non-permanent AF, no prior history of stroke or TIA, no indication for a permanent pacemaker or implantable defibrillator, and currently prescribed and taking a NOAC medication. The study is expected to be conducted in approximately 120 centers located in the United States. Roughly 6,000 subjects will be enrolled in the study to ensure 5,260 randomized subjects. To exclude patients with a high AF burden, external ECG monitors will be used in the study to screen approximately 7,800 patients prior to enrollment and randomization, which assumes a 30% screen fail rate. Approximately 2,630 smartwatch devices will be used in the study for subjects randomized to the treatment arm. To ensure a widespread distribution of data, minimize site bias in study results, and ensure that sites will be able to adequately manage and follow subjects enrolled in the trial, the maximum number of randomized subjects allowed at a single site is 200. The enrollment period is expected to last approximately 24 months. Subjects will be followed for 30 months and then exited. Therefore, the anticipated study duration is approximately 54 months. Outcomes Measures are listed as Stroke (all), systemic embolization, death, and major bleeds by ISTH criteria.\n\nAssessment:\nREACT-AF is a well thought out and innovative study that stands to potentially change practice for patients with a-fib.  The most notable hurdle to overcome is the coordination of data as it relates to the flow of information from the apple watch to a regulatory-compliant EDC system as well as the feedback loop to the patient (via an app) once their data is reviewed pertaining to their NOAC prescription directive, along with patient confirmation of receipt of this messaging.  Currently, there is a 25 patient pilot study that is validating the algorithm for AF detection.  The results of this pilot study will become available in the coming weeks but the preliminary report suggests high sensitivity and specificity.  To augment this data, it was strongly suggested that the investigator composes data specifically on the error rate of this novel automated pathway and what value a human might have on these error rates as a consideration for inclusion of a core lab for real-time review and/or random auditing of the data.  It is also important to fully understand the historical control data for the physician assessment pathway against which this automated pathway will be compared.  It is essential that the new system operates at an error rate at or below the historical control currently utilized in the clinic while also not compromising the testing of the primary hypothesis.  Patients for this study will come from both electrophysiology lab centers as well as general cardiology practices that can refer patients to the study.  Given the small scale of the pilot study, potential enrollment rate may be difficult to accurately model.  As such, the trade-off between using the 65 core sites currently "signed on" versus expanding this number to a group of sites that may or may not recruit as efficiently needs to be considered.  This study has the backing of the FDA (verbal at this point but reportedly an IND "would be granted" if there is indeed high sensitivity in the pilot data)  to push for the change in labeling of the safety insert for these NOAC drugs. The NOAC labeling change would be to advise (if positive study) that there may be a safe way to intermittently takes these drugs without increasing the risk for stroke versus how the inserts currently read (e.g., a black box warning about not discontinuing therapy).\n\nRecommendations:\n•\tObtain historical error rates from AF diagnostic routine clinical setting compared to error rates associated with the Apple watch pathway from pilot\n•\tConsider use of a core lab for selectively verifying AF readings throughout the trial.\n•\tInvestigator needs to compile a list of sites for overlap with the CTSA network with potential expansion to more sites.\n•\tInvestigator should develop plan for return of value & compensation (travel, time, etc.) for all participants.  Especially important in the control arm group who do not receive a smartwatch.\n•\tInterim analyses need to be planned out with early stopping rules for futility.\n•\tInvestigator needs to work with the watchband company, AliveCor, to determine messaging capabilities that can be built into their app software (vs. developing a stand-alone app).\n\nRecommendations for Comprehensive Consult:\n•\tEHR cohort discovery to aid in site selection and recruitment projections.\n•\tFeedback messaging system associated with AF detection and NOAC directive needs to be created and validated.\n•\tPilot data needs to be reviewed to determine error rates associated with the watch pathway and any implications it may or may not have on statistical analysis plan.\n•\tAssessment and bootstrap modeling of the current statistical plan.\n•\tSupport investigator in making IND submission related to the safety of trial's intermittent NOAC use.\n•\tRecruitment materials specifically targeted toward referral pathway from general cardiologist practices.\n•\tConsider/devise incentives for patients with a specific focus on control patients who would not receive a free watch.\n•\tDetermine scales to be used (SF-12, SF-36, Duke anticoagulation satisfaction scale), the timing of assessment, and method of collection for QOL and healthcare utilization.\n•\tcIRB planning is needed to ensure appropriate resources are available and to ensure multisite coordination plans include adequate human subjects protections\n•\tREACT-AF budget will need to be reviewed and integrated with CCC/DCC responsibilities.	f	\N	\N	\N
194	The proposal described Aim 2 as a comparison of patients who had been on drug for a significant period of time to those just starting drug.  We found this approach to be challenging in that it may be too confounded with time and selection bias.  We suggested Aim 2 be addressed by selecting patients prospectively and matching them in some fashion. The investigator agreed in concept but continued refinement of Aim 2 will be needed to achieve a successful grant submission.  Aims 1 and 3 seem appropriate and achievable given the current parameters of the project.	\N	\N	Because of the large number of CTSA sites (20 of 21 total sites) planned for the U.S. population of this study, use of a central IRB through TIN would be beneficial.	\N

171	The SPIRIT study is being done as a follow-up study of TOPCAT.  TOPCAT was a global trial that had difficulty with enrollment.  They added a number of sites globally with potentially inconsistent training at the additional sites.  The data collected from the TOPCAT study had geographical differences within it  (e.g., add-on/concomitant  therapy and timing of standard of care visits showing regional differences).  A large portion of the goal of the SPIRIT study is to use the Sweden registry along with sites in the US to decrease the amount of the geographical variation, but still allow for the enrollment of the number of subjects that are needed.\n\nThe study proposes an enrollment strategy that includes the majority of sites (68) and patients (2400) located in Sweden to utilize the SwedeHF Registry.  U.S. based sites (52) are a much smaller component of the total number of patients (800).  This raises concerns over the generalizability of the results to the U.S. population. Recommend the use of PCORnet and/or EHR cohort discovery for evaluation of site population.  \n\nThere was some discussion around the baseline characteristics of the study and the team noted that they were based on the data in Sweden.  Through the use of PCORNet and possibly the EHR-based cohort assessment (from the RIC), the teams can look at the patients in the US to see what the patients in the US would look like.  Additional follow-up occurred and the RIC is working on an assessment at the 5 pilot CTSA sites.  \n\nThe study hypothesis identifies a 20% reduction in CV mortality and this may be more than needed to be clinically meaningful.  Recommended to the team that they re-evaluate this target and the associated power calculations.  It was clarified during the consultation that the data from the SwedeHF Registry was used to drive the power calculations, there will be additional statistical discussions around this data.	t	\N	Because of the large number of CTSA sites (52) planned for the U.S. population of this study, use of a central IRB through TIN would be beneficial.

353	A 30 minute introductory meeting was held to introduce the JHU-Tufts TIC and ensure the PI's request for services was appropriate for the project. After the introductory call, a 60 minute meeting was held which consisted of a presentation describing the study and then an overview of central IRB services, given by JHM IRB director, Megan Singleton.\n\nThe CIRB services requested are feasible.  Four sites will be recruiting providers and participants and have already stated their interest.   No more than four sites will be open.  Help from their partnering network, the Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group (PCRC) will help with monitoring the study and with regulatory submission.	f	\N	The CIRB services requested are feasible. These services could be supported by JHU Trial Innovation Center's TIC CIRB. The JH TIC and TIC CIRB have staffing in place who are knowledgeable and trained to handle new research projects coming to the TIC with processes in place and forming.	\N

165	issues___1	The original budget of $1.9M submitted for funding to the Arthritis Foundation for funding appeared to be adequate.  The awarded $950K appears unrealistic to support coordinating center efforts unless additional funding is located.	\N	Yes. The network's current stage of development can support this trial given requests/needs are CIRB and Standard Agreement services.	Yes.  There is opportunity to collaborate heavily with the CTSA Program for 5 of the six sites planned to be part of the study.	An operational hypothesis requires more exploration as one does not exist within the current study design.  \nProposed Operational Hypothesis:   \n1)\tAn evaluation of start-up time for CTSA vs. start-up time for the Non-CTSA site as an evaluation both CIRB and standard agreement services. Operational hypothesis:  CTSA sites will activate faster than non-CTSA sites if both CIRB and standard agreement services are utilized.

243	issues___1	No.  Funding is categorized as inadequate by the submitting investigator.  Expectations were that the TIN/TIC provide support at their own cost.	\N	No. Requests for DB build and DSMB are not services that are currently offered within the TIN.  Any services provided by the TIN would be paid for by the TIN and not with study funds.	Yes.  There is an opportunity to partner with Industry sponsors to support this trial. ARISTA USA has already funded the study, however the CTSA collaboration would be limited with only 1 CTSA institution involved.	The need for an operational hypothesis was reviewed with the investigator.  None were identified within the current design.  Timing and funding mechanism make the inclusion of an operational hypothesis challenging on this study.  TIC could not identify a unique and/or valuable enough operational innovation opportunity to justify the financial commitment.
1	issues___1	Yes,  The budget seems to cover the full requirements for the study as outlined in the grant that was provided.	\N	The Trial Innovation Network could undertake this study at this time.  The study is not large or complex.\n\nThe discrete services that are being requested would be paid for by TIC/RIC funds.	There is opportunity to collaborate with other CTSA hubs for identifying the additional sites for the study.	This study will benefit by using the EHR cohort discovery tool for identifying the additional 11 sites.  This will also help the submitting PI with confirming that the number of sites is appropriate to meet their enrollment goals.  The use of the CIRB and the SAs will help get the study started in an efficient way.

114	issues___4	Yes, because it is largely taking a pragmatic approach of collecting standard practices at clinical sites the investigator anticipates a budget under the cap of 500k.	\N	Yes the preliminary work and data collection will be facilitated greatly by the rochester team along with a selection of sites from the consortia. It is not at a level of complexity that surpasses the resources or capacity of the TIN.	NINDS has already expressed interest in this proposal and the CTSA network has already been engaged from the investigators local CTSA LT POC and many will be collaborating throughout the comprehensive consult.	Operational hypotheses are listed in the slides and will be further worked out during the comprehensive consult.
49	issues___1	Yes the study and proposed budget are feasible.  Both of these items will develop as the consultation progresses (if approved to).	\N	Yes, the study size if small and would easily fit into the Network's current stage of development.	Yes, the team is still developing their site list so there is opportunity to collaborate across the CTSA Program.  Also, the submitting team has confirmed NHLBI that they are willing to work the Trial Innovation Network for implementation of this study if funded.	There is no current operational hypothesis included in this study, but the team is looking to make this study as easy and feasible to do and if possible build in some pragmatic components.  In addition, they are open to exploring additional operational  efficiencies that would be appropriate - some items that will be considered - use of eConsent to decrease study personnel workload and allow for remote monitoring, interactive DSMB reports instead of the usual paper reports, and a combination of remote and on-site monitoring.

82	issues___1	Based upon the initial feedback of reviewers, the study team revised and simplified the aims focusing more on the goal of producing achievable steps to transforming the use of exercise in child health clinical research and presented the role of each CTSA collaborator.  They reconfigured the clinical use-cases, now focusing on two pediatric chronic conditions, sickle cell disease (SCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF). These two diseases, both genetic in origin, are pathophysiologically quite different, yet each impairs exercise and physical activity across the lifespan in distinct ways. With the 'compare and contrast' opportunity of these two use-cases, an appropriate comparison group of otherwise healthy children, and by taking advantage of the funding period to follow the trajectory of CPET change across developmental stages Tanner 2-5, a critical period of growth and development, our statistical plan is now more robust. The 'collaboratory' has been reconfigured and now consists of three CTSAs with substantial programs in CF, sickle cell disease, and exercise science.	\N	Yes, as noted above.	\N	\N

During the initial consultation the team supplied a draft list of 41 potential CARRA sites and 31 of the 41 were CTSA sites (76%).  All of the sites in the draft list were located in the United States, however in discussions with the PI, they anticipate having 0-2 sites in Canada for this trial.  In addition, this trial would offer the opportunity to collaborate with NIAMS.	This trial seeks to inform the clinical care of JIA patients through inherent pragmatic features, as well as innovative operational approaches that streamline trial design and efficiency in clinical trials research.    Yes this trial presents several opportunities for innovation that are aimed at increasing quality and efficiency in clinical research:  o\tRedeveloping the study design to an adaptive/SMART design to best account for the multiple treatment arms and answer the clinical question with as few participants as necessary (streamline protocol, increase efficiency and reduce costs)  o\tUsing the existing infrastructure and EDC of the CARRA registry and supplementing only the study-specific data variables will streamline data collection  o\tUsing a centralized IRB with sites experienced in single IRB reliance model will streamline study startup activities  o\tAligning the standard of care clinical assessments and lab collection along with broad inclusion criteria will enhance generalizability, facilitate enrollment and translation of study results into real-world practice    Employing the above-identified strategies will improve the efficiency of clinical trials, increase the quality of the data produced, and ultimately inform the clinical care of JIA patients.  The operational hypothesis(es) and associated outcome measures will be further refined/defined during the comprehensive consultation process.

293	issues___2	Not discussed.  Budget discussions including CCC/DCC assignments to be conducted early in the comprehensive consult.	\N	Yes sufficient resources exist to take on this study with the proposed submission of Oct 5.	This proposal will be submitted to NINDS and notably includes only CTSA sites within the current site network of 10.	Implementation of an adaptive trial design has the chance to increase the efficiency and move quickly from dose ranging/dose findings to preliminary randomized efficacy study.
213	issues___1	Yes, already funded.	\N	The JHU/Tufts TIC has the resources to support this pragmatic trial and the total duration of the trial falls within the TIN funding period.  The 900 patients across 40-45 sites is reasonable and the recruitment period is expected to be completed within a few years.	This study is funded by PCORI who is excited about the partnership with the Trial Innovation Network.  Of the current site list of 40, half are CTSA hubs and a handful of sites are likely to be added from the CTSA network.	The investigators are agreeable to the list of operational hypotheses/innovations listed below and all are feasible to implement.\n\nImplementation of the 90-day start-up plan from JHU will improve overall site recruitment and performance compared to previous iterations of the trial and pharma trials in MS (Tufts-CSDD).\n\nEvaluating strategies to incentivize recruitment at a site level with dashboard reports sharing performance metrics\n\nProspective reimbursement assessments to ensure medication coverage approval to reduce dropout due to lengthy approval times or lack of coverage\n\nPiloting a fast-track system for patient appointment scheduling at tertiary care centers with historically long wait times\n\nElectronic capturing of patient reported outcomes during follow-up visits to increase accuracy of scoring and validity of measure

78	issues___1	During discussion we were able to arrive at a budget that would fit below the $500,000 limit of NICHD, and given\nthat the amount of data collection is relatively small, the budget is doable. There would not be significant site\nmonitoring.	\N	Any of the three TICs in the Trial Innovation Network has the capacity to manage this trial. The investigator has\nreally got no data coordinating center, is not part of any existing network, and five to six large maternity centers\nwould provide sufficient numbers of births. Discrete services would be largely irrelevant for this study - he\nwould need comprehensive consultation to help him prepare a competitive R01 application, and he would need\nsoup to nuts implementation as a Trial Innovation Network study.\n\nUpdate, March 2018: Yes, this proposal needs the Trial Innovation Network to strengthen his grant submission and help with his budget in order for him to have a scoreable submission.	The trial would be funded by another IC (NICHD). The investigator is open to any selection of clinical sites, which\nwould be from CTSA Hubs, presumably. The results of the trial could be very important and successful\ncompletion of the trial would provide a positive result for the TIN.	This trial will require significant consultation to develop into a competitive R01 application. One innovation that\nwas discussed during the consultation was to only enroll mothers to whom the screening tool would have\nresulted in an early induction, and then to randomize these women to the two arms. This will greatly strengthen\nthe signal to noise ratio. Operational hypotheses would need to be developed as the proposal matures.
